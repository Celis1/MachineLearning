But when he meets a snake and talks to it for the first time, and Dudley shoves him out of the way, he defends himself by setting the snake lose.

It’s taken me a long time to come to terms with my struggle and one of the only things I know to help me is re-reading the HP books, especially PoA. I can best tell people that depression is like encountering a dementor. It’s a struggle against a darkness that feels like it’s being forced upon you against your will, and that you’re never going to be happy again. It takes so much strength to find your good memories and produce a patronus to fight against it but there’s always hope.  I would like to think that my patronus would be a piece of the HP world because they have helped carry me to happiness so many times.

      "As it is stated multiple times in *The Deathly Hallows*, food is one of the five major exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. This means, to use Hermione's words,  \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;\"*Your mother*  *can’t produce food out of thin air, no one can. Food is the first of  the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration...  It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can* *Summon* *it if you know where it is, you can* *transform* *it, you can* *increase the quantity* *if you’ve already got some...*\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on this explanation, there are five substances, including the blanket term of \"food,\" which cannot be conjured out of thin air, or be created by transfiguring an unrelated object. This quote by Hermione, along with Ron's echo later on in the story, is the only information on this apparently fundamental rule of transfiguration theory we are given. Although I'm sure this topic has been discussed at some point before on this sub, I wanted to hazard a guess on the other four exceptions to this Law. Most of these are purely speculative, so let me know whether you agree or what you would suggest instead.    \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Wands**\\- I started out on this rabbit hole while pondering why a dueling wizard couldn't simply transfigure his opponent's wand into a rock or something, thereby promptly winning the duel. My assumption is that objects of sufficient magical power would be more resistant to transfiguration, or at the very least , wizards would be more loath to try, as it would leave them fairly helpless. Additionally, wands being an exception to Gamp's Law is supported by the sheer difficulty of repairing a broken wand, based on *CoS* and* TDH*.  \n",
      "2. **Magical Beasts**\\-I always found it interesting that across six books of transfiguration lessons, they Harry's class only ever seems to practice transfiguration on the natural animals known to us Muggles. Based on the progression of Harry's lessons, the difficulty of transfiguring an animal seems roughly proportional to the size and complexity of the animal being transfigured, as Harry wroks with mice in first year and large birds in fifth and sixth year. Therefore, that magical creatures on the whole tend to have more complicated biologically than ordinary creatures, and that irreparable wand cores come from magical creatures, I have a feeling many magical creatures would at the least be more resistant to transfiguration. I don't believe all magical beasts share this immunity to Transfiguration (creatures like flobberworms, I would imagine, would seem fairly easy to change). Instead, I propose this immunity is limited to the more powerful creatures of XXXX rating or higher.\n",
      "3. **Money/Precious Metals**\\- This is the most self explanatory of the bunch- you can't create the gold, silver or copper used to create galleons, sickels and knuts. If this were possible by means of ordinary transfiguration, there would be no reason to create a philosopher's stone. Plus, as many have pointed out before, the wizard economy is messed up enough with the easily exploitable exchange rate between their currencies, there's no way the economy could plausibly stay afloat if such rapid inflation were possible.\n",
      "4. **Souls**\\- Transfiguration cannot be used to create life where there was none previously, nor can it be used to resurrect the dead. Although animals are often transformed into inanimate objects throughout the series, according to [this interview with JK Rowling](http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm),  such transformations seldom last, and usually fade over time. Additionally, a major theme in the series is that death cannot be avoided forever, and that all method of supposed immortality- the Philosopher's Stone, Horcruxes, the Resurrection Stone- have major drawback and ultimately fail.\n",

Then no one would have gotten in trouble. What’s worse is that she was so desperate to keep Ron and Harry as her friends she was willing to throw away her morals and start breaking the rules.

As such, it's also possible that Ron's wand wouldn't have cared much if it was used against him.

Even though Harry was underneath the cloak, which is supposed to hide you from death. Within reason of course..  it doesn't block sound and why would it? It's a piece of fabric... But the idea is, that this invisibility cloak is supposed to be super powerful enough to hide you from death... Why is it then, that such a powerful cloak can be seen on a map made by 4 teenage boys in school? It just dumbfounds me how easily detectible Harry is under the cloak using a map. The cloak itself, is obviously special in some way, because when Harry first gets the cloak in book 1, Ron comments about how different Harry's cloak is from other invisibility cloaks and that even those cloaks are extremely rare.. so it's obvious that it isn't a normal Invisibility cloak and it has some differing qualities than that of others...

I started reading in late June, a friend of mine recommended it to me. Tbh I am 32, so i was around Harry's age when the books came out. I never showed an interest because to quote what I said back then \"wizards, brooms, and wands... Ugghhhh that's dumb\"... Started reading the first book and was hooked from there on out. Her characters are so likeable and I felt I have connected to everyone on a certain level. I kinda feel that waiting so long to read the books, I can see everything from a different perspective. Like for instance, I can remember Harry getting pissed and feeling \"yeah he has every right to be pissed\" at the beginning of The order of the Phoenix... The death of Dumbledore particularly made me bawl my eyes out. I was in mourning like he was an uncle or something. She knows how to make you care for everyone to some degree (except Umbridge, fuck dat bitch).  I knew something was up with Snape, didn't know exactly what. I was so glad to see he did the right thing and Dumbledore was right all along. There is so much more that I can say about the series as a whole, but I hope that I am welcomed amongst the potterheads. Now all I want is more lol it's kinda bittersweet, the last month and a half I've had these books to look forward to I'm my free time, now I'm kinda lost.. anyway I just wanted to introduce myself, later guys\n",

Hermione in the films takes the important parts of Ron's personality, which also results in her taking his good lines as well. It frustrated me when Hermione explained what the word \"Mudblood\" meant, when she said that \"fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself\" in CoS while in the books she didn't utter Voldemort's name until OoTP, and when she said that \"to kill Harry you'll have to kill us first\" when in the books Ron said that, exemplifying his bravery and loyalty.\n",

If they had an equivalent of Defense Against the Dark Arts, you can bet your bottom dollar that Godric Gryffindor would teach it.

In other words, he doesn't know everything. He fucks up going out with Cho hilariously, but he's not some suave ladies man just because he's famous. He's nervous and doesn't know what he's doing and it falls apart but the world doesn't end. And in OotP, he makes the huge mistake of being tricked into going to the ministry, resulting in the disastrous events of that night. That was obviously orchestrated by Voldemort and Harry  did everything he could to ensure it was the right thing to do, but either way he had to live with that guilt, like we all do when we get something wrong and hurt someone else. \n",

I doubt the average wizard would be happy about the fact that the person who's suppose to be on their side is in love with the darkest wizard of their time. So Dumbledore's romance won't be explicitly stated to the main characters, but the audience will see the love he has for him.\n",

Part of the joy of rereading the books is picking up on small bits of info JK Rowling gave us to foreshadow stuff for later in the books or later in the series. I am currently rereading the series gearing up for the new movie and I am on Goblet of Fire. I am over half way through the book and realizing there is not much foreshadowing that Moody is Barty Crouch Jr. there are hint here and there but on a first read I doubt anyone figured this one out. I am wondering if anyone has found good hints that I have some how over looked and I am curious to know if anyone on a first read figured everything out. I mean I put something together on a first read but the reveal of Moody being Crouch Jr. who's just been drinking polyjuice potion was not something I saw coming.

      "I was 11 and had been hearing about this new book called Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. I wanted to read it (I was HUGE into reading), so I approached my mom to ask her to get it for me. She does some research and decides it is satanic and I'm not allowed to read it. I was crushed, but I moved on. (this was probably around 4th or 5th grade) \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to 6th grade, my reading teacher is obsessed with HP and the first movie is about to come out. So I start seeing all kinds of Harry Potter stuff and I'm rapidly becoming obsessed without even reading it. I beg my mom to let me read it, she says we will see the movie and if the movie is OK I can read them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to the day we see it. I was instantly in love from second one. Movie ends, I look to my mom and she says yes!!!! We go to the store immediately and buy the first 3 books. The 4th was out at the time, but we couldn't find it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tiny child me is reading the book in the car on the way home, and it was love at first word. I've been truly obsessed ever since and I wouldn't be who I am today without Harry Potter. I'm actually getting goosebumps as I type this because it is something that is just so very important to me. \n",
      "I've been thinking about how there is an exchange rate for Galleons to Pounds at Gringotts  and how it could easily be taken advantage of by people like Mundungus Fletcher. Transfigure something mundane to be more valuable (doesn't even have to be magical a mutt to a pure bred dog for example) and sell it in the muggle world and exchange back to Galleons or even just using it to buy gold in the muggle world. I was thinking however there would be an amendment to the International Statute of Secrecy with the advent of modern globalism around not messing with muggle economies as they were becoming more complex and if they crashed from wizards glutting/raiding the market it would likely cause revelation. So the way I see it the Ministry of Magic probably sets the rate of exchange (not a free market) and does a trade of gold (raw not Galleons) for Pounds with the British government when needed. The British Pounds are then sold to the wizarding populace with it being handled in part at Gringotts because it is the bank after all. So the goblins are squeezing some percentage or fee on the transaction.\n",
      "It made Ron much more asshole\n",
      "Wow. Just, wow. I usually read the books before seeing movie adaptations, but the Harry Potter series was the exception. I read the first two books in elementary school, abruptly stopping after Chamber of Secrets inspired nightmares. My family continued reading the books, spoiling the major plot points as they went along. I got discouraged, feeling like the mystery was gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year, I decided to finally watch all of the movies. After seeing them, I decided I would pick up the books again this summer. I'm in love! Though some of the mystery was taken away already, I cannot put them down! I'm so glad I am finally experiencing (and sometimes crying my way through) these books. I am just starting Half Blood Prince and I cannot put the books down. The movies were good, but the books are on another level. Just, wow. \n",

I know it doesn’t follow the book very well but its the first harry potter movie I’ve seen in the theaters and at that time I hadn’t read the books so dumbledore’s death was pretty shocking lol.

      "This means that for the whole remainder of that book, Kreacher has been in close contact with, and likely very attached to, a piece of Voldemorts soul. Based on everything we know and have seen of horcruxes, it's very likely that piece of Voldemort had some sway of level of control over Kreacher. Is it not then possible that some of his actions during that book were heavily based on his corruption from the horcrux?\n",

But if Voldemort met his end for the first time at James and Lily Potter’s house when his killing curse toward Harry rebounded on him, did his wand somehow stay with him? Did Voldemort leave a corpse behind at that time? When he emerged from the cauldron in the graveyard, was his wand just automatically with him? \n",

And him being the master was a crucial part of his plan so why did he not defend himself?

I believe Hermione would have been brilliant enough to figure it out, and Harry and Ron were crazy enough to try it.  There could have been some really great chapters written of them in their animal forms sneaking around searching for Horcruxes or fleeing the Death Eaters.\n",

      "\n",

      "I am rereading PoA now and I can't believe I never noticed but in the chapter \"The Leaky Cauldron\" when Harry sees the Fire Bolt for the first time, shop owner says how Irish nation team just ordered seven of those broomsticks and how they are favorites for the next Quiditch World Cup. Never noticed that before and great little detail as we see Irish team in the Goblet of Fire in the final of the QWC. Awesome!!!\n",

      "When I’m working on my fanfics I always try to keep everyone as in-character as I can and I occasionally read back some passages to get a feel again for how certain characters talk and act. And no matter how many times I go back to these books, the friendship between Harry and Ron remains one of the most heartwarming things in these series to me. So here are just a few things that I greatly appreciate about the relationship between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, it starts with a friendship between best buddies who like the same things, both have a sense for adventure and have great interest in each other. They greatly enjoy spending time together and just having fun. But even in the first book this already turns into something deeper, as Ron proves his loyalty in their attempt to retrieve the stone before Voldemort can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mostly after that, though there were some hints already in PS, comes Ron’s inclusion of Harry in his family. Ron doesn’t think twice about including Harry in his family. Of course he’s not completely aware of just how much this means to Harry, but that doesn’t make it less heartwarming. CoS is one of my favourite books because of their friendship. Not just for things like Ron rescuing Harry from the Dursleys’. But this book also shows more of the friendly ribbing between the two, like Ron teasing Harry about Lockhart’s continued attempt to get some more fame through Harry. \n",
      "\n",
      "And we see a great moment of Harry being there for Ron when they go to the CoS to rescue Ginny. Harry feels helpless and not being able to help the Weasleys and knowing that Ron is grieving his sister is worse than anything that could happen to Harry himself. We are reminded many times at just how loyal these two are to each other. Sometimes that means standing between their friend and danger and sometimes it just means not supporting each other when they fail to find a girl for the Yule ball. Not to mention their loyalty for others. Ron even faces his phobia for Hermione and that takes a terrifyingly amount of courage and loyalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the series continues, we also see more and more accounts of Ron’s understanding of Harry and his defense of Harry. While Ron and Harry don’t understand each other completely, Ron often knows how to prevent Harry from brooding, how to keep his spirits up. For instance, when Harry manages to retrieve the golden egg and Hermione immediately wants to worry about the second task, Ron knows that Harry deserves a moment to celebrate. And when Hermione nags Harry or tries to argue with him, Ron is the one who knows that Harry hates confrontations like this and is there to act as a shield and distract Harry with a game of chess or quidditch. Not to mention their divination lessons have some of the best laugh out loud moments for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are so many more little things, like Ron giving Harry his blessing to date Ginny, which we know from his reaction to Michael and Dean means a lot, his trust in Harry’s leadership, his not even hesitating to follow Harry and watch out for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Which leads me to my last point and probably the most contested one; the fights between them. I know that probably a majority feels that Ron is the lesser of Harry’s two best friends and abandons Harry. I strongly disagree with this and think of Hermione this way, though I know I’m one of very few who think that. But I’ll just focus and Harry and Ron here.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think most of us have a friend like Ron or have had one at some point in our lives. Someone who you can have fun with and who is there for you. But sometimes the pot boils over, you have an explosive fight and hate each other’s guts for days or weeks. But with these friendships the argument is as easily forgiven and forgotten as it started. \n",
      "\n",
      "We see two major fights between Harry and Ron and both of them could have been prevented if there had been a little more understanding between them. Neither of the fights are a sign of disloyalty, of them being bad people. They’re a sign of two guys who don’t really talk about their feelings and don’t really recognize each other’s insecurities. Because that’s what causes those fights.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start with the first one: we all know that Ron didn’t really think that Harry put his own name in. It’s as Hermione says; Ron always stands in Harry’s shadow, is always second best and he never mentions it, never complains about it. And I think this is something hugely underrated about Ron. He’s always there for Harry. Ron and Hermione show Harry a lot more care than he shows them. And it’s understandable; Harry objectively has worse problems than they do and is therefore less concerned with regular teenage struggles than them. But Ron always feels like he’s second best, yet he always puts his own worries, his own insecurities aside to be there for family. Until one day, it went one step too far and those feelings he had been bottling up for three years came out and caused a rift. And as soon as he got to grips with his own insecurity and understood that Harry wasn’t basking in his fame and enjoying the tournament, he came back and spent his time supporting Harry again. And we know that Harry greatly missed him and appreciates his return.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a similar thing with DH, only worse. Not only is he still dealing with his worries about being second best, not just in his own eyes but in Hermione's as well, they’re in a war and Ron is cut off from his family. He had to choose between helping Harry stop Voldemort or staying with his family. And despite always feeling second best, even in the eyes of his mother, family means everything to him. Leaving with Harry meant not being there to protect his family and not knowing if they were okay, and it took its toll on him. Yet he made that choice without hesitation. And yet again, we see Ron and Harry’s bottled up feelings coming out in an explosion and regretting their choice the moment they make it. And yet again they come back and strengthen their friendship even more with the knowledge that they may have fights sometimes, but in the end they will always be friends and will even go into battle together. After all the growth he went through in the series, Ron has now fully managed to overcome his insecurities and proved himself as a friend for life. The more obstacles they overcome, the more their bond as friends deepens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said, I think many of us have a friend like Ron. Someone to hang out with, have fun with and someone who will always have your back when it matters, even when you fight sometimes. And we’re very lucky to have those people in our lives. \n",

      "So I made an \"it opens at the close\" reference organically in conversation that was noticed by two other Potter fans, my friend and her friend whom I had met once before, Another person at the table was confused by our random wink and a nod and wanted to know what was up. The friend of a friend incorrectly attributed the reference to GoF, which I ignored. As her explanation continued I stepped in at a moment of movies vs books to indirectly correct the mistake. It wasn't as subtle as I thought, but my friend stepped in and supported my correction. \n",

      "That the friend of a friend picked up on the reference is pretty excellent in normal conversation, but I'm not sure how to view this exchange in that I love and know the books and movies quite well, but am certainly not an expert as much as some on the sub.

      "At the end of PoA, Harry and Hermione have to be careful to not run into themselves from the past when using the time turner, but when Hermione is using it for classes she is disappearing from Harry and Ron's sides and re-appearing with no doubles. How does the time turner work?\n",

When Harry goes one grate too far and ends up in Knockturn Alley, he sees Draco eyeing the necklace he would eventually use to try killing Dumbledore. On top of the fact that Harry hid in the vanishing cabinet that allowed the Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts. Not sure if anyone else noticed these before.

      "I spent a lot of time trying to make sense of the wizarding world, and one of my biggest question was: why can't you cast wingardium leviosa on yourself? Or use Reducto on a person? Or use Accio on a person? They were never described to have projectiles, so wouldn't they be perfect for duels?  \n",
      "Eventually, I came to the conclusion that objects in the Harry Potter universe have an innate \"magical\" quality. And surely a wizard's body contain an immense amount of magical quality. Charms/transfigurations are mainly \"trivial\"(low magical power, not simple) spells on objects with low magical qualities (books, chairs etc) while jinxes are spells that are designed to affect a wizard's body. The concentration of power required is why they create projectiles and sounds. Curses are designed to affect a wizard's mind or soul to an extend, and is why they are so powerful.  \n",
      "This would explain a lot about duels in the book. It explains why dumbledore and voldemort used so many transfiguration spells in their fight, as they are less likely to miss and create zoning and protection, so that they can attack when there's an opening.  \n",
      "This also bring up another interesting point: bullets are most likely super low in magical properties. The more complicated the mechanism is for a gun, the less likely for it to work in the presence of a wizard anyway. I'd imagine any complicated muggle artifact would fail within Hogwarts ground, as even the small gears would rattle out of place. Also, we have never heard any \"muggle\" death mentioned in the series (car accident, shot, falling from height). This leads me to believe that if you shoot a wizard, their innate magical ability would just blow the bullet away. Or disintegrate the bullet. Or teleport them away, just like how it protects underaged wizard's. It takes a lot of magical power to kill a wizard, as even after death their magical quality allows them to become ghosts.  \n",
      "There are some small exceptions for this tho. One is Bellatrix throwing a knife at Dobby. I would imagine this worked (sed) because 1: Dobby is a house elf, so maybe not as much magical quality and 2: the knife was thrown by a wizard, and it's Bellatrix's personal knife so it might be magical too. Another exception is the possibility of shooting a magical bullet. But I'd imagine it would get clogged because of it's magical quality warping the gears. It takes a lot of engineering to get muggle technology working with magic, as Arthur showed us. Which also might be why they still use quills and lanterns, as they're easier to design with magical quality in them.By the time you can design a magical gun, we might be at laser guns already.  \n",

      "All we know is that Newt Scamander meets Tina and her sister in 1926 and captures Grindelwald and hands him to MACUSA, and the later events should somehow conclude with Dumbledore defeating Grindelwald finally in 1945, right? But what exactly happens between this time period (1927-45), does anyone have a theory about it? I'm especially interested to know the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. If Dumbledore assigns the task of defeating Grindelwald to Newt (as shown in trailers), then why does he have to himself come and duel with Grindelwald in the end? Did Newt fail in his task?\n",
      "2. Significance of Tina's sister Queenie and that Muggle, Jacob Kowalski. The four of them (including Newt) do make a good team like Harry, Ron and Hermione, don't they? What adventures are we going to see of them?\n",
      "3. Significance of Dumbledore being gay. JKR has recently blurted it out in the media that Dumbledore is gay, hasn't she? But we don't see any indication of that in the entire HP series, do we get to see that in the FBAWTFT movie series?\n",
      "4. Hogwarts Connection of Newt. Newt is being shown as studying at Hogwarts in a trailer (flashback story, maybe?). Its interesting to see who else he meets at Hogwarts during that time, do we get to see James Potter and Co. (Moony, Wormtain, Padfoot and Prongs) and even Hagrid perhaps?\n",
      "5. What about Grindelwald's influence on Voldemort? Do they ever meet?\n",
      "So how did Hermione Granger and Harry Potter attained such high posts in Ministry of Magic, if they didn't even completed their graduation?\n",
      "I've been going through the series in an odd way, reading the book then watching the corresponding movie, and it got me thinking. All the relationships in the books are portrayed WAY better than in the movies. There was far more subtlety in the HBP book between Ron and Hermione than in the movie and it's so much better!\n",

      "Learning that Harry et al were born around 1980-ish was deeply surreal for me. As an August baby, I wasn't yet 4 when the first book came out and started reading them not so long after - before I left primary school, definitely, so I'd say 7-8 years old. My mum used to tease me about having a crush on Harry and how a friend of mine at the time *looked just like Harry* (which he did - except he was called James, ironically). Except at that time I was a preteen, Harry would've been in his early to mid twenties.\n",

      "I have always used the Harry Potter universe as a comfort blanket. In August of 2016 a flood came through and destroyed our home in Louisiana. We lost everything (including all of my original hard copies of the books and the dvds from when they were released) and had to rebuild our home. It was a devastating time, mentally and financially. Now that our house is finished and we have moved back in, I am ready to decompress and disappear into the wizarding world. That means replacing my collection but with other expenses taking precedence, replacing them has taken me a while. I currently have the 1st and 4th books, and now I have the first 4 movies! It may seem silly to some but I feel like I have been reunited with an old friend. \n",

      "-\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry’s aunt and uncle met at work. Petunia Evans, forever embittered by the fact that her parents seemed to value her witch sister more than they valued her, left Cokeworth forever to pursue a typing course in London. This led to an office job, where she met the extremely unmagical, opinionated and materialistic Vernon Dursley. Large and neckless, this junior executive seemed a model of manliness to young Petunia. He not only returned her romantic interest, but was deliciously normal. He had a perfectly correct car, and wanted to do completely ordinary things, and by the time he had taken her on a series of dull dates, during which he talked mainly about himself and his predictable ideas on the world, Petunia was dreaming of the moment when he would place a ring on her finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, in due course, Vernon Dursley proposed marriage, very correctly, on one knee in his mother’s sitting room, Petunia accepted at once. The one fly in her delicious ointment was the fear of what her new fiancé would make of her sister, who was now in her final year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Vernon was apt to despise even people who wore brown shoes with black suits; what he would make of a young woman who spent most of her time wearing long robes and casting spells, Petunia could hardly bear to think.\n",
      "\n",
      "She confessed the truth during a tear-stained date, in Vernon’s dark car as they sat overlooking the chip shop where Vernon had just bought them a post-cinema snack. Vernon, as Petunia had expected, was deeply shocked; however, he told Petunia solemnly that he would never hold it against her that she had a freak for a sister, and Petunia threw herself upon him in such violent gratitude that he dropped his battered sausage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first meeting between Lily, her boyfriend James Potter, and the engaged couple, went badly, and the relationship nose-dived from there. James was amused by Vernon, and made the mistake of showing it. Vernon tried to patronise James, asking what car he drove. James described his racing broom. Vernon supposed out loud that wizards had to live on unemployment benefit. James explained about Gringotts, and the fortune his parents had saved there, in solid gold. Vernon could not tell whether he was being made fun of or not, and grew angry. The evening ended with Vernon and Petunia storming out of the restaurant, while Lily burst into tears and James (a little ashamed of himself) promised to make things up with Vernon at the earliest opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This never happened. Petunia did not want Lily as a bridesmaid, because she was tired of being overshadowed; Lily was hurt. Vernon refused to speak to James at the reception, but described him, within James’ earshot, as ‘some kind of amateur magician’. Once married, Petunia grew ever more like Vernon. She loved their neat square house at number four, Privet Drive. She was secure, now, from objects that behaved strangely, from teapots that suddenly piped tunes as she passed, or long conversations about things she did not understand, with names like ‘Quidditch’ and ‘Transfiguration’. She and Vernon chose not to attend Lily and James’ wedding. The very last piece of correspondence she received from Lily and James was the announcement of Harry’s birth, and after one contemptuous look, Petunia threw it in the bin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shock of finding their orphaned nephew on the doorstep a little over a year later was, therefore, extreme. The letter that accompanied him related how his parents had been murdered, and asked the Dursleys to take him in. It explained that, due to the sacrifice Lily had made in laying down her life for her son, Harry would be safe from the vengeance of Lord Voldemort as long as he could call the place where her blood still existed home. This meant that number 4, Privet Drive, was his only sanctuary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to Harry’s arrival, Petunia had become, if anything, the more determined of the Dursleys in suppressing all talk about her sister. Petunia had some latent feelings of guilt about the way she had cut Lily (whom she knew, in her secret heart, had always loved her) out of her life, but these were buried under considerable jealousy and bitterness. Petunia had also buried deep inside her (and never confessed to Vernon) her long ago hope that she, too, would show signs of magic, and be spirited off to Hogwarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading the shocking contents of Dumbledore’s letter, however, which told her how bravely Lily had died, she felt she had no choice but to take Harry in, and raise him alongside her own cherished son, Dudley. She did it grudgingly, and spent the rest of Harry’s childhood punishing him for her own choice. Uncle Vernon’s dislike of Harry stems in part, like Severus Snape’s, from Harry’s close resemblance to the father they both so disliked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their lies to Harry on the subject of how his parents had died were based largely on their own fears. A Dark wizard as powerful as Lord Voldemort frightened them too much to contemplate, and like every subject they found disturbing or distasteful, they pushed it to the back of their minds and maintained the ‘died-in-a-car-crash’ story so consistently that they almost managed to persuade themselves it was true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though Petunia was raised alongside a witch, she is remarkably ignorant about magic. She and Vernon share a confused idea that they will somehow be able to squash the magic out of Harry, and in an attempt to throw off the letters that arrive from Hogwarts on Harry’s eleventh birthday, she and Vernon fall back on the old superstition that witches cannot cross water. As she had frequently seen Lily jump streams and run across stepping stones in their childhood, she ought not to have been surprised when Hagrid had no difficulty making his way over the stormy sea to the hut on the rock.\n",
      "\n",
      "#J.K. Rowling’s thoughts\n",
      "\n",
      "Vernon and Petunia were so-called from their creation, and never went through a number of trial names, as so many other characters did. ‘Vernon’ is simply a name I never much cared for. ‘Petunia’ is the name that I always gave unpleasant female characters in games of make believe I played with my sister, Di, when we were very young. Where I got it, I was never sure, until recently a friend of mine played me a series of public information films that were shown on television when we were young (he collects such things and puts them on his laptop to enjoy at leisure). One of them was an animation in which a married couple sat on a cliff enjoying a picnic and watching a man drowning in the sea below (the thrust of the film was, don’t wave back – call the lifeguard). The husband called his wife Petunia, and I suddenly wondered whether that wasn’t where I had got this most unlikely name, because I have never met anybody called Petunia, or, to my knowledge, read about them. The subconscious is a very odd thing. The cartoon Petunia was a fat, cheery character, so all I seem to have taken is her name.\n",
      "\n",
      "The surname ‘Dursley’ was taken from the eponymous town in Gloucestershire, which is not very far from where I was born. I have never visited Dursley, and I expect that it is full of charming people. It was the sound of the word that appealed, rather than any association with the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dursleys are reactionary, prejudiced, narrow-minded, ignorant and bigoted; most of my least favourite things. I wanted to suggest, in the final book, that something decent (a long-forgotten but dimly burning love of her sister; the realisation that she might never see Lily’s eyes again) almost struggled out of Aunt Petunia when she said goodbye to Harry for the last time, but that she is not able to admit to it, or show those long-buried feelings. Although some readers wanted more from Aunt Petunia during this farewell, I still think that I have her behave in a way that is most consistent with her thoughts and feelings throughout the previous seven books.\n",

Also, do you think it can sense evil and is obligated to tell the headmaster if he's put on a student who's really nasty? For example, when he sorted Tom Riddle, do you think he saw the terrible things he did while at the orphanage? Or did it just sense that Tom was really ambitious? I know it can read your thoughts real time as well. If this means it is capable of legilimency, and Snape was able to see Harry's memories, shouldn't it be able to view the wearer's?

YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO!'”    \n",

      "I modeled my thinking around how Star Wars organizes their very extensive canon. This is just how I see it all, but it seems like a concise way of separating things.

But in Prisoner of Azkaban (I want to say it's for Harry's birthday, but I could be wrong), Hermione gives Harry self-flossing mints, which I assume are pieces of floss that floss the teeth themselves, which points to the fact that wizards are aware of teeth care.\n",

In Order of the Pheonix, we also see Mrs. Fig send her cat, Mr. Tibbles to keep tabs on Harry after the dementor attack and report back to her to provide some sort of coverage on Harry in Mundungus Fletcher's absence. We know that squibs went to Hogwarts at some point and that they are still involved in the magical world even though they can't do magic. We also never seem to see wands from either throughout the entire series. What if, upon discovery of their squib status, their wands were transfigured into cats that they have a telepathic link to? This would also explain why the cats seem to have extraordinarily long lives. The wand chooses the wizard so there clearly seems to be some link between these transfigured catsfrom that same relationship. I don't know about you, but giving a squib a magical companion that will allow them to almost be in two places at once is a much kinder option than simply breaking their wand and forcing them to choose which world to live in alone.\n",

      "Where do you think Voldemort made his home base in between reviving himself at the Little Hangleton graveyard and taking over Malfoy Manor? I always assumed he stayed at Riddle House, but it occurred to me that he might have considered it too risky since Harry escaped and could tell Dumbledore where he was. Since he seemed to largely bide his time and gather strength/allies between the Third Task and the Azkaban breakout, I'm thinking now he might have wanted somewhere less obvious to hide out. I can't see him trusting any of his followers that were currently out of Azkaban to serve as a Secret Keeper either. All of the Voldemort timelines I find online seem to think he moved to Malfoy Manor sometime between summer 1996 and August 1997 so that still leaves almost an entire year where we don't know his whereabouts for sure. I'm thinking there are a lot of interesting possibilities but I'd like to find the ones that fit the best with canon evidence. Thoughts?\n",

      "So, the Calrinbrothers have a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFnmdHERn_c) regarding the origins of The Veil from the Ministry of Magic, The Pensieve from Hogwarts, and The Mirror of Erised.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick summary is that the Peverell brothers created The Deathly Hallows (as Dumbledore suggests), but before they did so, they made some prototypes so to speak. Ignotus created The Pensieve, Cadmus created The Veil, and Antioch created The Mirror of Erised. According to the SCB, they harnessed the power of thestrals to conquer death. Maybe thestral bone for the stone of the Veil/Resurrection Stone, thestral blood for the Pensieve/Cloak of Invisibility, and obviously thestral hair for the Elder Wand.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love this theory so much, except for one thing.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mirror of Erised doesn't fit. It is newer (first described in 1891), and it uses English language, not runes like The Deathly Hallows and The Veil. Now, the frame could have been added to the mirror later (much like the ring was added to the Resurrection Stone), but even that doesn't really fit the essence of Elder Wand. Yes, both the Elder Wand and the Mirror represent what it is most desired, but so does the Resurrection Stone, right? It just seems like the Elder Wand represents an unrelenting desire for *power,* in political, social, and physical regards. The Mirror doesn't really match that quality. Plus, we have no idea where the Mirror comes from.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, there are few things that I think need to be improved on outside of replacing the Mirror. Another thing is that The Veil and The Pensieve are said to be found, and they both are purported according to legend to be the focal area of the founding of two very powerful and influential buildings in the Wizarding world of the UK: Hogwarts and Ministry of Magic. And I think that is important.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the thestrals are also super important to why I think the Mirror of Erised isn't one of the \"Original Hallows.\"   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "From Pottermore:  \"While somewhat intimidating in appearance, these carnivorous horses are emblematic of a journey to another dimension\"     \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Both The Veil and The Pensieve literally take you on a journey to another dimension (to the past or to the future/death). The Mirror of Erised is much more stationary - it could represent the present - where we are all stuck. But again, I just don't think it fits with the wand, and it doesn't lead to another dimension, per se. But still, it got me thinking.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The SCB theorize that Peverell brothers created the Veil and Pensiever, but I suggest that they merely studied them at each location - Hogwarts and the building that would one day become the Ministry of Magic's Headquarters. The veil and pensieve were already present, and they are much older than the Peverell brothers.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I tried to think of a building that was also founded around a magical artifact. And I couldn't think of one.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I *did* find a magical building that was built in between the time Hogwarts was founded (990 AD) and the Ministry of Magic was founded (1707 AD, though the building might have been built much earlier) and is completely mysterious. And it also matches the personality of the Elder Wand better than the Mirror - the corrupting effects and the fear and powerlessness. That place is Azkaban.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To add to this theory, though not built by him - the founder of Azkaban Prison is named Damocles, reminiscent of the courier who switched places with King Dionysus. A Sword of Damocles is meant to be a position of great power, but great peril (Much like the Elder Wand). It was built in the 1400's, and was already a place of great power.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And from JKR herself: \"Those who entered to investigate refused afterwards to talk of what they had found inside, but the least frightening part of it was that the place was infested with dementors.\"   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dementors are one of the most frightening things within the Potterverse. It is what Harry's boggart manifests as. What could be more frightening and horrifying than having your soul slowly eaten, replacing every positive memory with despair, until you die, or are subject to the kiss? Perhaps a magical portal to hell? According to JKR, she named Azkaban partially after the Hebrew word, Abaddon, meaning \"the depths of hell.\" This could have been Antioch's inspiration for the Elder Wand - a literal gate of immense physical power - striking fear in everyone.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And not the strongest evidence - but in the film, the figure of Death in the Tale of Three Brothers looks awfully like a dementor (as a dementor looks awfully like a grim reaper). JKR was heavily involved in the films, so I doubt that she would change her vision for Death to be so comparable to a dementor unless it was purposeful.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is the artifact? There isn't any information - because those who have seen it, do not dare to speak of it.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What are y'all's thoughts on this? Stupid? Interesting? Does it improve the SCB's theory?   \n",
      "\n",
      "In \"The Prince's Tale,\" we see bits and pieces of Dumbledore's plan, but one part that never made sense to me is the part about Nagini. Specifically, he tells Snape to tell Harry to sacrifice himself *after* Voldemort has begun protecting Nagini:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;\"There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake.\"  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;\"For Nagini?\" Snape looked astonished.  \n",
      "&gt;  \n",
      "&gt;\"Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So we see that Dumbledore was intended for Nagini to still be alive *and under Voldemort's protection* when Harry learns that he must sacrifice himself. But if that was the case, how was he supposed to kill her? (Or if for some strange reason he *wasn't*, why send him on the rest of the horcrux hunt before that point?)\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry certainly believes that he was supposed to kill Nagini himself, and he laments the fact that he didn't in the next chapter:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: the snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet from Dumbledore's words, this looks not like overestimating Harry, but like a serious mistake in his planning. Even if the course of events he'd intended was different (as seems likely), Nagini would still have been under magical protection at this moment, with no way for Harry to get to her. What was he really thinking?\n",

      "Harry Potter is not a story about intergalactic space wizards fighting over a cosmic force, or demigods fighting elves and wizards for a mystical continent. It is a very human story about an young boy who is struggling with girls and bullies who just wants to pass class and practice sports, who is forced into larger than life situations. Therefore, the villain will reflect the genre of the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of all the overlords we have seen recently, Voldemort is the most human and most relatable. While lacking the scope of Sauron or Palpatine, his story is about a man who couldn’t escape his insecurities and shame. He was an outcast as a child and his father abandoned him. This led to his irrational hatred towards Muggles, and his desire to avoid the fate that had took his mother away. The implications that his mother willingly chose to die pushed him into seeking immortality. Notice upon entering the magical world he is envious of anyone who has ties to powerful wizarding status (Gringotts vaults, Hogwarts founder artifacts) because they make him feel he doesn’t belong as much as they do. So he steals them and lies about his Muggle past. That is great development for a villian that is pure evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, Voldemort is terrifying. A Muggle-raised orphan with no knowledge of magic brought an entire magical country into disarray and confusion, conquering it within a couple months after Dumbeldore died, and made significant progress outside the country. The fear of Voldemort is what caused the Ministry to be so indecisive for a year. Voldemort losing to Harry is due to preordained events happening in Harry’s favor, notably the power of love. From the moment Voldemort killed Snape’s love, he was doomed.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, I may be mistaken, but I don't think we get any real reason for Voldemort's turn to evil besides a thirst for power. I was thinking to myself, \"That can't be it. That can't be the only reason he turned evil. Nobody turns bad JUST for power. They need an inciting incident to give them a reason to thirst for power. It's storytelling 101 - though J.K. Rowling doesn't necessarily need to follow the rules to make great stories.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So why did Voldemort turn evil? It's simple. You see, Tom Riddle the younger actually visited his father several times while he was at Hogwarts, in between semesters, in an attempt to mend a broken relationship, that of an orphan and his father. These bonding experiences helped them both to feel compassion and love for one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one of these excursions, he and his father were playing \"I've Got Your Nose!\" However, on his father's turn, the dopey muggle lost track of poor young Tom's nose! Amazed at his newfound ugliness and disgusted by the half-wit of his muggle father,  the newly-minted Lord Voldemort used a rare potion to make himself appear normal, while negative feelings stirred and stewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, he ran out of the potion, and nobody knew how to replace it. As a result, Voldemort felt a good many feelings: self-loathing for his macabre appearance, helplessness for his inability to get his nose back or appear normal, and his ever-growing resentment for his muggle father, who not only abandoned him as a young child, but also lost Voldy's nose! \n",
      "\n",
      "The Dark Lord gained a thirst for power, creating horcruxes because he knew, deep in his heart, that he'd need to search the cosmos for eternity to find a skin care supplement supplement that could make him handsome again. He started a campaign to eradicate muggles and restore pure blood to wizardkind, so nobody else lost their nose. And, finally, the mighty Lord Voldy gathered followers and made them wear masks, so he wouldn't feel embarrassed that they had noses and  he didn't! \n",

The only other option would be that someone else hid him and his brother and then brought him along via side-along apparation, but that does not explain why he would have been in the Great Hall with the other Gryffindors before Harry had even returned to the RoR to let the others know what was happening (Harry didn't even know about all the people that had arrived at that point). \n",

Then, a new wizard comes up, who isn’t afraid of the muggles, who wants to use the technology and resources his “race” has to get back at the muggles. He is eventually defeated and thought of as bad for stooping to their level, but he’s just mad his ancestors had to face horrible treatment and wants to make sure no future generation has to.

I understand why some people could be upset about Depp being allowed to remain in the cast, but I feel that with personal matters like that, the inly two people who really know what went on are depp and his wife and for all we know , she could have attacked him first or maybe there was alcohol involved, etc. A lot of studies show that very often it is women who assault men first but if the man ever hits her back even in self defense, he is branded an abuser and thrown in jail, which is a very big double standard.

Actually, from what I heard noma dumezweni did a great job and I have no issue with it, but what annoys me is how jk Rowling has basically tried to re-write her own canon and pass off hermione as black when she was clearly white all along. In the books, there is a line where Hermione is described as having a white face and another where she is described as having her face blush bright pink (like a white person's does when they're excited). Also, by having Emma Watson portray her in the official film series and thus, basically becoming the face of Hermione,  this seems to definitely imply a white ethnicity, especially when you consider the fact that it takes place in UK , which is a white country. Jk Rowling pretty much has tried to insist that Hermione was either black or not described as being of any race when she clearly was white and when fans tried to point this out, she called them racists and apparently blocked them. \n",

I don't troll politicians that I don't like and I don't bash them over stupid things like spelling a word wrong, like she does. The thing she did where she accused him of ignoring a disabled boy (even though he didn't) made me sick to my stomach. Its like she just bashes anyone she disagrees with politically and it comes off as extremely childish and shallow. If you disagree with someone, you should use facts and logic and build a good thesis for why you disagree with them or their policies. You don't just look for petty reasons to bash and mock them like she does. \n",

      "But the thing that really gets me about her is her complete queerbaiting throughout HP. Don't even get me started about remus and sirius... she wrote them as if they were a couple... the famous forty line stare... The joint Christmas gift... The way they cling to each other like a married couple... The whole lupin being a metaphor for a gay man with aids thing... And then she kills off Sirius and completely bastardized tonks' character from fun, spunky, Independent auror with pink hair to lovesick crybaby stalker who throws a tantrum right after Dumbledore's death and gets the weasleys to gang up on lupin with her... Honestly, tonks entire character in books 6 and 7 completely disgusted me and I don't understand how any fans even like her \"romance\" with Remus... It was so forced and fake and was entirely based off her selfishness. It just struck me as so sickening and toxic but I'm not gonna make this post an anti tonks/lupin rant... The bottom line is that she made both Sirius and lupin come off as very gay (and even the director of the third movie noticed it abd told David thewlis to play lupin as a gay junkie), and then she completely destroys it and makes lupin apparently straight...\n",
      "\n",
      " Another thing that some people have noticed is that in book 5 she used a lot of lesbian stereotypes for tonks... Short spiky pink hair, kinda tom boyish,   almost described as like  the spunky lesbian trope (similar to tracer from overwatch)... and then in books 6 and 7, she makes her straight... Some have called this queerbaiting as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then you have the thing with Albus and Scorpius in cursed child... I have not read it nor have I seen the play, so I don't really know much about it, but I've heard that apparently the two boys have some serious gay moments between them and they hug a lot and are very touchy feely with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "But i think the biggest thing that has made people angry at JK Rowling with the queerbaiting stuff is the whole Dumbledore dilemma... The fact that she never described him as gay in the books... Yes, there is some subtext there (such as him wearing flamboyant robes and liking to knit or the fact that he was very unusually obsessed with Grindelwald to the point that he was about to throw away his whole future to run away with this very handsome blonde man and become a mass murderer with him), but it is never outright stated that he is a homosexual and this has always bothered me. She has had 7 novels, 9 movies (ten if you count the upcoming one) and even a two part play, but she absolutely refuses to put it in to the Canon that Dumbledore is gay. \n",
      "\n",
      "And another thing I noticed is that she played on an extremely negative stereotype for gay men with grindelwald aka Percival graves in the fantastic beasts movie... She made him out to be a complete creep with credence and his interactions we're akin to that of sterotypical pedophile's interactions (how touchy feely he was with credence, how seductive and manipulated he came off as,) and yes, I know that he did not actually care about credence or love him in any way, but this is still playing on the stereotype that gay men are predators who target underage boys. I've seen other people talk about this and a lot of people (especially parents) were very offended by it. Its like JK claims to support the gay community so much yet she openly makes it look bad with stuff like this. She totally queercoded Grindelwald in such negative way in the first FB movie... \n",
      "\n",
      "And again, with the announcement that Dumbledore will not be \"explicitly gay\" in these movies, it really makes me wonder if he is even gay at all or if she just said he was as a publicity stunt for money by attracting gay fans. \n",

      "Is it possible that someone at warner brothers or bloomsberry is stopping her from having Albus be openly gay out of fear that it will alienate people and hurt profits? I don't know. \n",

      "What do you think? I know I primarily made this rant about her queerbaiting, and she definitely comes off as very cop-out like  to me, but even with the other stuff (calling anyone who disagrees with her politics or \"black Hermione\" a racist, blocking people on Twitter for stupid things, etc.)?\n",

      "This was just a random thought I had, but I felt like it would have enchanted Tonks’s character and the dynamics of the books if Tonks had lived through the 2nd Wizarding War and raised Teddy by herself. We have no representation of single mothers in the Wizardng World. I understand the argument can be raised for Remus, but I think he always belonged back with the Marauders but Tonks would have been given so much more depth if she would have been allowed to raise Teddy by herself.\n",
      "This is one of those theories that sounds absolutely ingenious if you refuse to think about it for more than 5 seconds. Even if you ignore the fact that we're shown in the first couple of chapters of PS that the Dursleys are pretty awful to begin with, this theory only works if we pretend every time Harry was around someone, their temper skyrocketed.\n",

      "In POA, after Sirius's recapture, Dumbledore mentions speaking to Sirius and reveals to Harry and Hermione that he believes them when they say Sirius is innocent. Great and all, since the trio now has someone other than Lupin to listen to them, however that would mean that the whole time Sirius was in Azkaban, Dumbledore never bothered to interrogate him. Now, while I'll buy that everyone was totally convinced of Sirius's guilt not to get him a trial, Im surprised that no one tried to squeeze any information out of whom they thought was a spy for Voldemort and his right hand man. While that's the kind of incompetence Id expect of the Ministry, you'd think Dumbledore, considered one of the greatest and wisest wizards  of the age wouldve been eager to find out what Sirius knew. After all, Sirius was part of the Order of the Phoenix which Dumbledore lead and the group that Sirius had supposedly betrayed by passing information to Voldemort including where to find the Potters to kill them. Once Sirius was secure in prison, Dumbledore's priority should have been getting Sirius to spill the beans on what he relayed to the Death Eaters, if the Death Eaters knew the names of Order members, names of Voldemort supporters and also importantly the names of any other spies in Order (because it would be arrogant to just consider one spy). Sirius couldve told Dumbledore the truth, that he wasnt the spy and that Pettigrew had betrayed the Potters and everyone else in the Order and was currently alive and running amok. Dumbledore couldve used Legilimency to see that Sirius wasnt lying and used his influence to try to set Sirius free. Even if setting Sirius free didnt work out, at least there wouldve been someone on the outside who knew the real truth. Perhaps Sirius wouldnt have gone crazy in POA trying to get to Pettigrew if he knew he could trust Dumbledore. Perhaps he could relayed a message to Dumbledore either by owl or through Crookshanks warning him that Pettigrew was at Hogwarts disguised as a pet rat of a student and maybe Dumbledore couldve taken steps to capture Peter and try to keep Sirius and Harry safe. \n",

The way they cling to each other like a married couple... The whole lupin being a metaphor for a gay man with aids thing... And then she kills off Sirius and completely bastardized tonks' character from fun, spunky, Independent auror with pink hair to lovesick crybaby stalker who throws a tantrum right after Dumbledore's death and gets the weasleys to gang up on lupin with her... Honestly, tonks entire character in books 6 and 7 completely disgusted me and I don't understand how any fans even like her \"romance\" with Remus... It was so forced and fake and was entirely based off her selfishness. It just struck me as so sickening and toxic but I'm not gonna make this post an anti tonks/lupin rant... The bottom line is that she made both Sirius and lupin come off as very gay (and even the director of the third movie noticed it abd told David thewlis to play lupin as a gay junkie), and then she completely destroys it and makes lupin apparently straight...\n",
      "\n",
      " Another thing that some people have noticed is that in book 5 she used a lot of lesbian stereotypes for tonks... Short spiky pink hair, kinda tom boyish,   almost described as like  the spunky lesbian trope (similar to tracer from overwatch)... and then in books 6 and 7, she makes her straight... Some have called this queerbaiting as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then you have the thing with Albus and Scorpius in cursed child... I have not read it nor have I seen the play, so I don't really know much about it, but I've heard that apparently the two boys have some serious gay moments between them and they hug a lot and are very touchy feely with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "But i think the biggest thing that has made people angry at JK Rowling with the queerbaiting stuff is the whole Dumbledore dilemma... The fact that she never described him as gay in the books... Yes, there is some subtext there (such as him wearing flamboyant robes and liking to knit or the fact that he was very unusually obsessed with Grindelwald to the point that he was about to throw away his whole future to run away with this very handsome blonde man and become a mass murderer with him), but it is never outright stated that he is a homosexual and this has always bothered me. She has had 7 novels, 9 movies (ten if you count the upcoming one) and even a two part play, but she absolutely refuses to put it in to the Canon that Dumbledore is gay. \n",
      "\n",
      "And another thing I noticed is that she played on an extremely negative stereotype for gay men with grindelwald aka Percival graves in the fantastic beasts movie... She made him out to be a complete creep with credence and his interactions we're akin to that of sterotypical pedophile's interactions (how touchy feely he was with credence, how seductive and manipulated he came off as,) and yes, I know that he did not actually care about credence or love him in any way, but this is still playing on the stereotype that gay men are predators who target underage boys. I've seen other people talk about this and a lot of people (especially parents) were very offended by it. Its like JK claims to support the gay community so much yet she openly makes it look bad with stuff like this. She totally queercoded Grindelwald in such negative way in the first FB movie... \n",
      "\n",
      "And again, with the announcement that Dumbledore will not be \"explicitly gay\" in these movies, it really makes me wonder if he is even gay at all or if she just said he was as a publicity stunt for money by attracting gay fans. \n",

      "What do you think?

Then the third and fourth year could be Hufflepuff because who at 13&amp;14 didn't need a little bit more kindness in their lives. I think this would also encourage empathy though, for your classmates and others, which is important for building a better society. Then Ravenclaw, for when the students are really starting to get into their studies for the fifth and sixth year. The Owls are important, and preparing for any after Hogwarts opportunities, it would be at this time that studies would be the most important. Then Slytherin would be the last year, because it takes cunning and ambition to get somewhere after school (hogwarts), and be to be an adult in the real world. \n",

      "\n",
      "Of course a lot of this is down to them being teenagers and as a result neither have the experience or the emotional maturity to take that step from being friends to being more but another factor is that they were friends, and they were both well aware that there was a greater risk of announcing their feelings because if the other did not feel the same way, well they have essentially ruined their friendship. It basically took both of them 4 years between figuring out their feelings to actually getting together and 4 years is a huge amount of time (4 years is minimum too as it may have been longer) and this was filled with a lot of jealousy, hurt feelings and insecurities because neither were able to figure out what the other wanted.\n",

In his youth he may have but for a very long time he is the guy who is always two steps ahead of everyone else, so why would he just suddenly throw the ring on? I don't believe he wouldn't study it, find out exactly what the curse was, exactly what would happen, even try using it without cursing himself. It doesn't make sense. i mean he knew full well that the sword would destroy the ring that's why he left it to Harry, so no need to put it on for that.  \n",

He only left Harry two items, both incredibly important it would seem. I think he accepted the curse willingly. I mean obviously the stone works so why didn't he use it to recall his family even though he was cursed, if that was indeed the truth.  \n",

He had to do it to not only protect Draco who Dumby knew would never do it (and then probably be killed by Voldy), but also to protect the elder wand (Draco disarmed Dumbledore, but Snape killed him leaving a false trail, two steps ahead again). He knew that Snape would be more likely to kill him if he was already poisoned. He knew that seeing Snape kill Dumbledore would be undeniable proof to The Dark Lord that Snape is to be trusted, leaving Hogwarts in relatively safe hands (than if someone else had been given the job). Also he knew Harry would have to make the same sacrifice and found it fitting that, if he is to expect harry to die to save the world then he should do the same.  \n",

Of all the things she could turn something into, she chooses a rat? I think this offers an insight into her sense of humour: snarky and enjoys it at the expense of others, being amused if she scared someone. Petunia is certainly the type of person to be scared and disgusted at rats. This is also later shown when she almost smiles at James's joke of pulling down Snape's pants. The only time Hermione laughed at the expense of someone else is when she was being personally attacked by them or if they were Malfoy. \n",

      "&gt;full of life and energy; active and outgoing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily was a person who was sorted into Gryffindor with the hat barely touching her head. From the description we have we can reasonably deduct that Lily loved life and lived it to the fullest, a trait most Gryffindors had. She was energetic, not a person who always has her head buried in a book. You'd most likely find her outside in the Greenhouses or the Forest, handling the plants or climbing trees. Or maybe chatting her time away with others. She was light-hearted, not always serious. ight-heartedness is defined as 'amusing and entertaining', which again hints at her very being avery funny person, bringing amusement to others. She joked with people, sassed her Professors and probably had quite witty-comebacks. She was liked by people, as we know she's popular. I don't think, for the slightest moment, Lily would barge in the middle of a party with a disproving look on her face, shouting at everyone that it's against the rules and yet still remains well-liked and popular because she's 'fun'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't sound like Hermione to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Animated:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;full of life or excitement; lively.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was spirited, she had a presence around the room. Animated people sometimes exaggerate stuff. A common trait of people with a lot of excitement also include using animated hand gestures, never sitting still or maybe too talkative because they have a lot to say about everything. However, that's obviously not always the case, but highly possible with the ways she talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;'You make me SICK.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually in books, when a character speaks like that or a word is capitalised, it hints a bit at their bubbliness or excited nature, a tendency to be talkative and animated while you talk. However, that's what I have always seen from what I've read and maybe I'm reading too much into this. But it's still not very similar to Hermione. But judging from the the way Rowling describes her, 'marched', when she was angry at Snap, it suggests she was one of those kids who will make their emotions and feelings pretty obvious. She also had her 'nose in the air'. I imagine the image of that wild, younger sibling with scraped knees and a lot of bottled up energy, dirt between her fingernails, always in the outdoors and only comes back after it's late out. She was also quite emotional in canon, we actually see her crying two times. Firstly, when on the train and secondly, when the McKinnons died. She was a person with strong emotions, and wore her heart on her sleeve. This 'hyper-logic' that Lily is always portrayed with crops out of nowhere, Intelligent does \\*not\\* mean logical. Nor does it necessarily mean a person is creative. She seemed like one of those people who finds the shortcut and thinks quickly in tight situations, when Slughorn talked about the bezoar. However, he never specified that Lily did exactly did but it can be deduced that she thought quickly in emergencies. \n",

      "\n",
      "Doesn't sound like a goody-two shoes to me. Or a follower of rules. Or maybe a strict person. Or a killjoy. She might have taken it too far at times, resulting in her being not cheeky, but downright rude. Just like her son. Cheeky people are mostly people who voice their opinions and Lily would have certainly done so, as she was very strong-minded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't sound like Hermione to me.\n",

      "We also know Lily broke the rules. \n",

      "&gt;'Mummy told you not to'\n",
      "\n",
      "That was right after she jumped out of the swing, which hints at recklessness and seeing as Lily was immediately sorted into Gryffindor, I think it's safe to assume that she really was reckless later on in life. She didn't seem to have a 'secondary' house and Gryffindor has quite some fatal flaws, including recklessness. I think the fact that she was immediately sorted there makes it obvious she was the 'idea' image of a Gryffindor. Rowling certainly highlighted the fact that bravery was one of her most prominent traits. Her sorting:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, “Gryffindor!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowling:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;When Aunt Petunia said Lily turned teacups into rats, she was exaggerating a little, although \"just like her son, Lily was not averse to testing the limits of the Statute of Secrecy, so you can safely assume she will have had a few warning letters – nothing too serious, though.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily quite clearly broke the law, not just simple school rules. That doesn't sound anything like hermione, at all. Hermione only broke rules after she befriended Harry and Ron and she only did it when she was fighting for her own moral compass. That, and the McLaggen incident, but that was actually quite out of character for Hermione, which even Harry noted. Lily, however, seemed to do this daily. And I think it's also worth noting that Rowling thought Petunia was exaggerating Lily 'turning teacups into rats' so maybe the humour comment doesn't stand. But I think that since the first think we learn about her personality is 'vivacious', it makes her on the opposite side of Hermione's personality. I also think she might have been irritatingly talkative:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;“It is real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn’t it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She repeats the same thing five times using different words. I usually find it quite irritating but I don't know about others. But as far as I know, Hermione would never talk like that. Hermione is straightforward and to the point. Lily seemed to be bit too excited here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lily was also chosen as Head Girl. This proves she had good leadership abilities and quite a great social standing among her peers. Hermione isn't popular, nor is she out-going. And I don't think she show-cased that much leadership in the books. But I haven't reread them in along time, so please correct me if I'm wrong. If you want anyone to compare Lily with within the books, then don't compare her to Hermione (or Ginny), compare her with someone like Tonks, who she seems a bit like, but that doesn't mean they're identical. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also know Rowling is fond of symbolism and hinting at personality traits through wand woods and such. \n",
      "\n",
      "\\&gt;Willow is an uncommon wand wood with healing power, and I have noted that the ideal owner for a willow wand **often has some (usually unwarranted) insecurity**, however well they may try and hide it. While many confident customers insist on trying a willow wand (attracted by their handsome appearance and well-founded reputation for enabling advanced, non-verbal magic) my willow wands have consistently selected those of greatest potential, rather than those who feel they have little to learn. It has always been a proverb in my family that he who has furthest to travel will go fastest with willow.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it seems to me Lily had some type of insecurity. I think it's most likely related to her status as muggleborn since she asks Snape if it makes a difference, being muggleborn. But this could mean a lot of very different things as well. Maybe it was because she found herself to never fit in in either worlds: Petunia rejecting her on own side and the Death Eaters killing people like her on the other. Hermione is never described as particularly insecure. The person who *is* insecure, however, is none other than Ron Weasley. She shares a a few traits with him so far: bravery, humour, popularity, playfulness, insecurity and quick-thinking. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily also seemed naive, something Hermione could never be described as such. For example, she clung onto her friendship with Snape for over five years, despite *knowing* full well that he was taking up the Death Eater ideology. This hints at her maybe thinking that he could change, she could turn him over, suggesting degree of innocence and naivety. And judging by Lily's kindness, it was possible she had too much of that, which is tied to . She befriended the poor and ugly neighbourhood whom everyone avoided, and quite literally looked like a bat. She later on remianed friends with him for over five years despite him now being a future Wizard equivalent of a nazi and stuck up to him when no one else did. Snape was obviously deeply disliked and yet Lily stuck by his side until he called her mudblood. I think she should have done that earlier but she did. Maybe she was too clingy, or too deep thinking of a the past, not seeing the future. Hermione never did that. She called people out not heir crap quite numerous times and I'm pretty sure if she found out Harry or Ron were aiming to be Death Eaters, she'd drop them as friends. As I've said before, Rowling is fond of symbolism, so I'd take a look at her name. Lilies symbolise motherhood, but they also symbolise innocence, which is linked to naivety. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily was her own person. She was quick-thinking, kind, hilarious, energetic, outgoing, fiery, emotional, extroverted and a lover of mischief, causing trouble. Lily was also people-smart. She was popular and Rowling described her as quite a catch. Lily was a spirited young warrior, who was quite a happy little girl. Now tell me if *that* sounds like Hermione. I don't think James would fall for someone like Hermione, at all. Lily certainly seems much more James's type, someone who'd always keep him amused and who would keep up with his sense of mischief, quite keen on joining him on expeditions. It's unfair to Lily, who was her own person. By the fandom's general logic, Lily, Hermione and Dirk Cresswell all had the same personality because all three were intelligent muggleborns. \n",

In the book it is said that dumbledor simply did not want snape to be tempted by the dark arts again. This is far from true because only dumbledor knew the best of snape, however cruel he was. The real reason why dumbledor did not want snape to take the position is because he was afraid if he did snape would fall victim to the jinx and leave hogwarts, or be harmed/killed. This is why he finally let snape take the job when he was cursed by The ring and only had a year left to live knowing. What do you think?

He did what is widely known as the best directed Harry Potter movie, and I think his visual style is what we need after David Yates’ pretty uninspired look for every single movie he’s directed.

      "3. I believe Harry becomes a major disappointment to those who are loyal to Voldemort due to associating with a half blood. That said, I think Harry would have contact with either the followers of Voldy, or the man himself, and he’ll refuse allegiance. On that note, he further divides himself from those in his own house who have family loyal to Voldemort. \n",

      "4. Some in Slytherin wouldn’t really care at all about who Harry made friends with. Being a Slytherin myself, I wouldn’t really care who Harry decides to make friends with, so I would just keep studying for that difficult Divination exam that’s coming up. \n",

      "This might have been posted or mentioned before but i thought it was interesting so here it is.  i always wondered how the oldy voldy got his body back in GoF without a horcrux but i missed the part when Voldy west side mentions that he got the “Weak body of his own” form from a potion made by Nagini’s venom and Unicorn Blood. so the horcrux he used was Nagini. Killing splits the soul in two pieces and one can be stored in an object or a snake in this case. what happens when you use that part of the soul? it splits it in two again and one half remains in the horcrux while the other forms a body? if he would die but have had a horcrux existing would he need something like the sorcerer’s stone? why didn’t he need one with the diary? because he was gaining the strength of a living person (Ginny). but then again why did no one have to die for him to come back with Nagini’s venom? i imagine his comeback happened when he got that itty bitty smol body since the connection with harry started but no one was sacrificed there either unless i missed something. does this mean each horcrux works differently? The diary needed another person’s energy, Nagini needed Unicorn blood and i don’t think we know anything about the other ones unless i’m missing something. and another thing is that what was that volderinho who possessed Quirrel’s body? when he killed lily his soul splited, then his curse on harry backfired and killed the part in him and left the other half in harry. so where did that part come from? was it split when he killed james? \n",

Now with all the added story and details from Pottermore, Cursed Child, Fantastic Beasts, and all the other little things she keeps throwing out there (Dumbledore being gay, the 't' in Voldemort being silent, regretting putting Ron and Hermione together), it feels like she's just messing with the world I came to know and love.  I feel like when she was writing the original 7 books, that's when her inspiration and obsession with HP was strongest, so that's when the best work came out.  I imagine that when she finished Deathly Hallows, she sat back in her chair and exhaled a bittersweet sigh of relief.  I remember closing Deathly Hallows after my first readthrough during the original publishing run and thinking \"Well, that's it, and what a hell of ride.  I love this story and world.\"  I thought she was done.  But now every time she releases new info, because it's so long after, it always just feels fake and ingenuine to me, like she's saying \"Hmm, I just had this idea I wish I put in, so I'm gonna force it in now, regardless of how bizarre it sounds.\"  Basically she's George Lucas-ing Harry Potter.\n",

      "But now with all the added stories and details from Pottermore, Cursed Child, Fantastic Beasts, and all the other little things she keeps throwing out there (Dumbledore being gay, the 't' in Voldemort being silent, regretting putting Ron and Hermione together), it feels like she's just messing with the world I came to know and love.  I feel like when she was writing the original 7 books, that's when her inspiration and obsession with HP was strongest, so that's when the best work came out.  I imagine that when she finished Deathly Hallows, she sat back in her chair and exhaled a bittersweet sigh of relief.  I remember closing Deathly Hallows after my first readthrough during the original publishing run and thinking \"Well, that's it, and what a hell of ride.  I love this story and world.\"  I thought she was done.  But now every time she releases new info, because it's so long after, it always just feels fake and ingenuine to me, like she's saying \"Hmm, I just had this idea I wish I put in, so I'm gonna force it in now, regardless of how bizarre it sounds.\"  Basically she's George Lucas-ing Harry Potter.\n",

Also, I think this movie has some of the best cinematography out all the other films to be honest (I mean just look at the whole cave scene).

Harry received the invisibility cloak, then receives the snitch with the resurrection stone inside, then in a roundabout way receives the wand, which forgive me but I cannot remember what it was called. The really powerful one from death. All of these items were in possession of Albus at one point, and so it's not a stretch to assume that Dumbledore had possessed all three simultaneously. If not, then he certainly would have been able to at some point. \n",

      "As the master of death, wouldn't he have been able to find and defeat Voldemort and his horcruxes? I believe he could have, but the question is why didn't he? I can see Harry being a problem, as a living horcrux it would be unethical to kill him, but also, how many people died to protect Harry? And how often was Harry's life knowingly risked as well as his peers in an effort to expose Voldemort? Isn't it ironic? It seems like Albus could have been more direct in orchestrating the death of Voldemort. \n",

      "I believe that a few times Albus tried to let Harry and Voldemort meet to let the horcrux situation resolve itself, but it was not well thought out. By letting Harry possess the invisibility cloak, knowing that if Harry was ultimately defeated by Voldemort, that the invisibility cloak would exchange hands. This could have left Dumbledore with less advantage. \n",

We all know the Elder Wand would change loyalties if its owner got disarmed during a duel, because that's what it's supposed to do \\-being the ultimate dueling wand and everything\\-. Then some people claim that the rest of the wands take intent into consideration, therefore they know if you're just 'practicing' a disarmament charm or actually meaning to disarm the person (just like the unforgivable curses know whether you really mean to cast them or not), determining that way if they will change allegiance or not.

      "I just finished binging all the movies through Deathly Hallows Part 1 (soon I'll start the audiobooks, I read all the books as a kid but find little time to read these days).  It strikes me that not only is Harry and Ginny's sudden relationship in Half-Blood Prince odd but its even more striking because he started a relationship in OOP which makes a lot more sense.  In OOP Harry is clearly suffering from PTSD after having witnessed a horrific murder and suffering greatly.  He was tortured before with the deaths of his parents and having fought for his life multiple times but he never really dealt with death directly head-on until then.  The movie (and the book as I recall) goes way out of its way to show that his isolation and anger are not simply the result of the knowledge that Voldemort is back while everyone denies it or the result of his adolescence but the result of PTSD.  His classmates cannot understand what it is like to watch someone die, let alone in such a massively horrific manner.  None of them understand what he is going through, except one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luna, like Harry, has both lost parents and witnessed a horrific death when her mother died experimenting with magic.  She alone understands what he's going through.  When Harry shuts everyone else out he never shuts out Luna.  In fact, the two open up to each other about things they never discuss with anyone else.  Through the course of the next few books, she becomes as integral to the plot and as well-rounded a character as anyone.  Looking at it as an adult Luna's introduction to the books at a time when Harry is going through something no one else understands and in the same year that he has his first romantic relationship it definitely feels like she was originally intended to be a love interest.  Even their personalities are almost perfect mirrors to James and Lilly.   Harry is very much like James but Luna is very much like Lilly.  In the Malfoy's dungeon, she even calls Dobby sir showing house elves more respect than anyone in the series besides Hermione and Harry.  She does this repeatedly, always respectful, always caring, always loving, always seeing the best in others even when they cannot see it in themselves, just like Lilly.\n",

      "\n",
      "At this point, Vernon makes the mistake of insulting the Potters and Dumbledore. This is btw the first \"bad thing\" he does in the entire chapter after enduring insult upon insult towards himself and his son. In return, Hagrid proceeds to attack Dudley, who as far as Hagrid knows has done absolutely nothing to deserve it (since the chapter makes it clear he knows nothing about the Dursleys treatment of Harry).\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards he only feels bad for using magic at all, since he's not allowed to use it. No remorse for attacking an innocent kid (again, as far as he knows). No attempt to reverse the damage. Instead, he finds the whole thing hilarious and, of course, insults Dudley some more.\n",

      "\n",
      "It got me thinking about other things witches and wizards use that seem to be the same or are adapted versions of muggle things, like the wizarding wireless radio, the Hogwarts Express etc. Do you think those are things that wizards invented and then they somehow got discovered by the muggles and are used without knowing they're magic, or is it maybe the other way around? Like maybe a wizard saw muggles using elevators and thought they were a good idea so they magicked them up a bit and started to use them too? Or maybe wizards and muggles invented their own versions of each thing independently? If any of them did come from muggle inventions, how do you think those who don't accept muggles in the wizarding world feel about using the magic versions of muggle things?\n",

      "My memory of the books and movies isn't as thorough as other people's here, but I seem to recall that Snape called HP \"Harry\" in the early books and in his last scene (in the movie) he calls him \"Harry\".  I was thinking about this because I believe that Snape's attitude toward Harry changes over the years. And I don't entirely believe him when he tells Dumbledore that he's still protecting Harry solely because of Lily. Is there any evidence for this in how he calls Harry? In the early years he uses \"Potter\" because he's really using Harry as a stand\\-in for his hatred for the older Potter, but then later in the books he maybe uses \"Harry\" more as he comes to see him as an individual?\n",

The backfired spell shouldn't have harmed him at all, but why did he lost his body?

There's only one logical answer: That Voldemort knew of some dark magic that would have allowed him to transfer a piece of soul from one container to another. But if that's the case, why didn't he move his soul from Nagini to something else? After all, when he started visiting his horcrux locations to strenghen their defenses once he learned Harry and gang were after them, he started encasing Nagini in a magical force field. \n",

Hufflepuff I feel is my least common, and Ravenclaw can be ruled out as well, I think, as I never felt particualrily drawn to it, but Slytherin and Gryffindor are two completely different stories. The first time I took the Pottermore sorting quiz, I was placed in to Gryffindor, and most fans would think 'well, that's that', but as I looked into it more I realised that the quiz only gives you about 8 out of 28 questions, one question involving what animal you would take to school. When I found this out I felt cheated, and tried to find a test that would encompass all 28 questions. I found multiple, and always bounced back and forth between Gryffindor and Slytherin. I knew none of them were JKR's test, so I found an analysis of the Pottermore quiz, and yet I still fell on two sides of the line.\n",

If presented with a choice, I would choose Gryffindor, but there's another voice telling me it's not up to you. The houses seem so vague most of the time, and Dumbledore tells us it's our choices and our actions that tell us who we are. It's hard being a Gryffindor, I think to myself, because everyone just thinks you're a basic fan, but it's hard being a Slytherin. People often think you're evil, that you're only rooting for yourself. Merlin was in Slytherin, I tell myself, and Pettigrew was in Gryffindor. I know that probably doesn't make any sense, but it's like I'm constantly trying to find pros and cons.\n",

      "George Spry has become the richest wizard in the world all through hard work and determination. He was a muggle born in London and loved watching cartoons. When he turned 11. He was accepted into Hogwarts and was in the Ravenclaw house. He saw first hand the large technological gap between the wizard and muggle world Muggles had color photos,television,and the internet I while wizards still used owls to get all of their news. In year four he created his first invented what he called the MAGICOLOR! Camera. He had simply taken a wizard camera and changed both enchantment and equipment until he had the first colored wizard camera. The Daily Prophet quickly bought several cameras from him and made him a consultant on their photography team while still allowing him to go to school. The work of the camera was shown to the whole world in the March, 24, 2015 issue of the daily prophet which suddenly put a lot of attention on the young George. Newspapers in the United States and Germany attempted to reverse engineer his cameras but they were cursed to explode if that was attempted. To this day most don’t know the inner-workings of Spyre Tech INC. He got a small amount of money each year from The Daily Prophet which he contributed many better cameras to when he felt the quality was too low. He graduated from Hogwarts and was approached by the daily prophet to be given a job which, to their surprise, he refused. He used some of the capital that he had made from The Daily Prophet and other newspapers to purchase a property on diagon alley and began to sell more of his cameras at a decent price. However, he was working on something far greater behind the scenes. Three years later he released the first Wizard Television and his rise truly began.\n",

      "If you think about the horcrux’s and where they were hidden, only the cup and the locket were hard to find. The ring, the diary, and the diadem were all very poorly hidden and extremely easy to find.

      "1. The diary= I mean if you’re going to put a part of your soul into an object you should probably try to hide the object as well as you possibly could.

      "\n",
      "3. The Diadem= this is probably somewhat well hidden but it’s clear that so many other wizards have also been in the room of requirements to hide things. The fact that Riddle thought that he would be the only one who had to hide something in Hogwarts is just idiotic on his part.

      "This may turn into more of a rant than I’d originally intended, and I’m sorry, but re-reading OotP it frustrates me to no end that Harry forgets about the package Sirius gave him. He buries it away saying he’ll never use whatever it is because he thinks talking to Sirius will lure him out of Grimmauld Place, never opening it to at least even see what’s inside. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then a few months later he decides he really wants to talk to Sirius again. He dwells on this for two weeks and comes to the conclusion that Umbridge’s fire would be the best way to reach him, never considering the fact that Sirius gave him a package that he told him would let him do literally that. Even if he didn’t think he was going to use it wouldn’t it be at least worth opening to see what it was? \n",
      "\n",
      "And sure, let’s give Harry some benefit of the doubt, there was a lot going on at Hogwarts when he got back, maybe he forgot about one of the last things his godfather told him last time he saw him. Oh, but don’t worry, he remembered he had the magical lock-opening knife Sirius had given him the previous Christmas that he’d never since used or thought of, so at least he didn’t have too much trouble getting into Umbridge’s office.\n",

      "The Harry Potter books are flooding with deep and complex characters, and females are certainly no exception. We have Hermione, Luna, Molly, Narcissa, Alice, Ginny, McGonagall, Tonks and Andromeda, to name a few. They are all undoubtedly strong female characters and Lily Evans is certainly no exception from these women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I stand by what I say: Lily is overrated when it comes to her capabilities as a witch but she is also immensely underrated as a person and a character. Sure, there are arguments that she is one-dimensional but she is in no way a weak person and from what we know of her, however little that may be, she knew her self-worth and won't let others walk over her.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me to my first point: Lily was not a trophy wife waiting at the end of the race for James or Snape to happily be given off to whomever reaches her first. She is worth much more than two ships. Lily is treated by both sides of this ship war as someone in the middle of a tug-of-war game of sorts. That is obviously very wrong and repulsive, to say the least. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily is one of the strongest female characters in the books: she can choose for herself, and she certainly did. Neither James or Snape 'deserve' her like some prize. She is her own person, she can make decisions on her own. She was write in cutting Snape off and has my full support. She was locked in a toxic friendship and that was the last straw for Snape. It was certainly not a 'slip of the tongue'. You can't just call your friend an equivalent of a racial slur and say it is a 'slip of the tongue'. If Lily was black and Snape called her a n**** it would cause outrage and there is something that is certainly very wrong if it was the first thing you thought of when your friend tried to help you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even if some Snape fanatics are right and Lily was a manipulative jerk and James never matured, then she also has a choice, however wrong it is. But as we've established, that is obviously not the case. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily is her own person, she can make her own choices and she can choose to date whoever she wants and choose to marry whoever she is comfortable with. She is not obligated to run off after Snape and comfort him for his *own mistake*. She did tell him that she knew he called others 'mudblood' and she was the exception to Snape's own twisted ideology, as a teen at least.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily handled that situation like a pro. If it were me, I'd have run off crying but she made it obvious on the spot that she was going to have none of that anymore. She stood up for herself and that is extremely admirable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Add to that that Lily is a person with high emotional intelligence, brilliant at potions in her own right, and was certainly not judgemental and very kind (choosing to befriend Snape at such a young age when kids would have certainly avoided him), that makes her a strong person, with a very strong moral compass, confident in her own abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second point:\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously Hermione is one of the most prominent characters in the series, and she overshadows Parvati and Lavender. These two characters are judged so harshly around here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parvati is given flak for apparently being 'ungrateful' to Harry at the Yule Ball. Excuse me? Harry was the one who left her and she was expecting him to dance with her. No, he just sat down with Ron and they started talking like they do every single day. They always do that. Couldn't you dance with her? It's common human decency, you know. \n",
      "\n",
      "Parvati is extremely underrated by the fan base and reducing her to nothing more than an ungrateful gossipy and shallow person when she is so much more than? Parvati is one of my favourite minor characters and she shouldn't be reduced to such ridiculous traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parvati knows what she wants. She went with her, he treated her like a jerk, so she went off to see some other guy. She came there to do whatever she wants and she went and did exactly that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parvati was the first person to stand up to Neville in the Philosopher's Stone, when he was being talked about by the Slytherins. She didn't tolerate such crap, which obviously shows us that by such a young age she didn't stand up to injustice. That is a trait which she shares with Lily, Hermione and Ginny, all characters that are regarded as strong in their own right. Why is Parvati any different? Because she giggled with Lavender over the Yule Ball? Just because Hermione didn't doesn't make her shallow. Because she thought Firenze was attractive? That's perfectly normal. Because she thought Hagrid was a rubbish teacher? Hagrid has potential as a teacher and he has some great lessons. But even Harry, Ron and Hermione thought that Hagrid wasn't exactly great either and only stuck around because they were friends with Hagrid, and loyal to him. She voiced her opinion, and Hermione did as well, later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;'Did you see his face, the great lump?'\n",
      "&gt;'Shut up, Malfoy,' snapped Parvati Patil. \n",
      "Page 158, Philosopher's Stone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another example of this is when she stood up for Lupin when Snape was insulting him in front of the class. And yet another example, in book three when she comforts Lavender when her pet rabbit, Binky, died. \n",
      "\n",
      "She also shared a pretty cute moment with Hermione in The Half-Blood Prince, in my opinion, she showed some sympathy to Hermione when Ron was being a jerk, to say the least. She helped her out where Hermione was frankly not great at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parvati is also brave, as demonstrated when she joined the DA, not many would have done so. She is also committed to what she likes, as clearly shown by how she continued divination. Another example of her sympathy is when she and Lavender comforted Trelawney when she was expelled. Their relationship with their teacher is under appreciated to be quite honest and also quite beautiful. Trelawney rare got any people who cared for her subject but she and Lavender did. \n",
      "\n",
      "Parvati is strong, knows what she wants, unafraid to voice her opinion, sympathetic, emotionally intelligent, committed to her passion, stands up to injustice and very brave. These are all traits that are very needed nowadays and Parvati demonstrates those. Reducing her to a shallow person does her a great injustice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Onto Lavender Brown now: I personally don't like her, but reducing her to another shallow person because of her giggly nature and un-Hermione personality is also unfair. Yes, calling Ron 'won-won' was cringey and so was her christmas present. Yes, she was clingy and irksome but really, she might have been new to this whole 'romance thing'. But how is she shallow exactly? She giggled with Parvati at various things but since when does that mean that if a person giggles, it's suddenly shallow. Yes, she did laugh with Ron when he made fun of Hermione but she was just immature and later grew out of it (if she did survive the battle, of course). Also, her breakup with Ron was just a bit hurtful, to be honest. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lavender also joined the DA, demonstrating her bravery and her desire to fight. She later fought at the Battle of Hogwarts, which demonstrates her great bravery. She is much more than a giggling girl obsessed with divination. She was just a normal teen, give her a break. Not everyone is Hermione and everyone has different personalities. She was supposed to be a barrier between Ron and Hermione and served as a foil to their relationship but she was caught in the middle of Ron and Hermione's antics. \n",
      "\n",
      "For my third point: Can I just say how much of an underrated character Mrs. Crouch is? Her sacrifice for her son's freedom is an example of a mother's love that is very overlooked in the books. She was already sick and went to Azkaban, literally hell on Earth, so that her son could have a chance to live a normal life. Some might argue that it's naive, but she obviously loved her son and sacrificed her entire future for such an ungrateful piece of crap. She was described as frail and wispy, and she was obviously sick, whether it was because of her son's betrayal and crimes or just a blood malediction, she knew she wouldn't las there. Her sacrifice is the mist underrated in the series, in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, yeah... I needed to get this off my chest. There are other points as well, but I guess they're more commonly addressed around here (Cho's weepiness, Tonks as insensitive, Ginny being a 'slut' and a Mary Sue, Hermione only being book smart and nothing more, Molly being a judgmental love-potion brewing nightmare). \n",

      "I see a lot of hate towards David Yates for not exactly copying the books or not doing some scenes. But he’s my favorite Harry Potter Director because he made a lot of the book moments very cinematic looking, and the style of the world stayed consistent from Order of the Phoenix onwards. I can understand where some people are coming from but some stuff that’s exciting to read in a book would be so boring to watch on screen, so I understand why he changed some stuff to better fit the movies. I don’t know maybe it’s just me but I found his movies to look the best cinematically and have some of the coolest moments.\n",
      "Just to be clear this isn’t meant to be against you guys as fans it’s actually my own fault really, I was just curious if anyone else has had a similar problem. So a couple years ago I read the Harry Potter books and watched the movies then decided to jump onto the internet and join the fans in my love for it. At first it was great, it was interesting to see so many fans with diverse views on the topic but soon I found myself changing my own opinions because people presented so many good arguments as to why I should ship certain couples or like and dislike certain characters and I began to be disoriented as I jumped from one opinion to the next. For example I’ve gone from being indifferent towards Ron Weasley to hating him to loving him and back to hating him and I’ve one from shipping the canon couples to some plausible non canon couples to completely bizarre pairings. Again I take full responsibility for being so easily swayed by other fans opinions and influenced by fanfictions I’ve read. But now I can’t even read the books or watch the movies without obsessing over all the fan theories and thinking about the things people have said about the characters, plots, shipping, etc. I don’t even know what my own opinions are anymore, I can’t remember what my original thoughts were about the series before I joined the fandom, everything has become so distorted for me and I have a hard time enjoying what I initially loved. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I guess my question is, has this happened to anyone else? Is there a way to fix it so I can rediscover my true thoughts/feelings/ideas/opinions about Harry Potter that are not influenced by others or the fanfictions I read and just enjoy the books and movies as they were?\n",
      "I just figured maybe JK based the educational structure of Hogwarts off of maybe the kind of school she went to growing up.

      "I am 17 years old. I started reading/watching Harry Potter when i was in 3rd grade. Growing up, I had always hated Draco Malfoy. But as I've grown older-as I've learned more-as I've seen more, I think Draco might actually be my favorite character. As a kid-he was a bully. I hated bullies. They were mean. They were arrogant. And of course, they were Draco. But now that I am 17, I see Draco's story in a different light. I see a story of a boy who was forced a life of hate upon by his father. I see a boy forced to murder, even though he didn't want too. I see a boy who was a death eater, even though he was not evil. A common criticism of Draco is that he isn't brave-that he's in fact a coward that hides behind his big ego and his tough friends. But, I regard his decision not to tell Bellatrix and the others that they have Harry as arguably the bravest thing anyone did in any of the books. Sure, some may say it was out of cowardice of murdering someone, but I in my eyes it is a braver move than a coward move. If he told the Death Eaters that it was Harry-he would be forgiven-he would be validated. But he didn't. He gave it all up, and he was brave enough to stand up to all the Death Eaters and turn himself away from the forces of evil.\n",

After watching this scene my wife brings up the point that if basilisk fangs can destroy horcruxes, then why when Harry was impaled with the fang did the horcrux inside him not get destroyed? I said maybe it had to do with the fact that he was a living thing, and he must actually die, like in the final book/movie, for the horcrux to be destroyed.

Realistically, why did one of the Death Eater's not tell LV that Snape had a chance to kidnap Harry Potter but left him? At that immediate moment above, Harry was extremely vulnerable.

      "Ok, so this theory relies mostly on information obtained from the e\\-book Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies from Pottermore, where the steps to become an animagus are explicitly outlined, they are as follows\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For the space of one entire month (from full moon to full moon), a single leaf from a Mandrake must be carried constantly in the mouth. The leaf must not be swallowed or taken out of the mouth at any point. If the leaf is removed from the mouth, the process must be started again.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Remove the leaf at the full moon and place it, steeped in your saliva, in a small crystal phial that receives the pure rays of the moon (if the night is cloudy, you will have to find a new Mandrake leaf and begin the whole process again). To the moon\\-struck crystal phial, add one of your own hairs, a silver teaspoon of dew collected from a place that neither sunlight nor human feet have touched for a full seven days, and the chrysalis of a Death’s\\-head Hawk Moth. Put this mixture in a quiet, dark place and do not look at it or otherwise disturb it until the next electrical storm.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. While waiting for the storm, the following procedure should be followed at sunrise and sundown. The tip of the wand should be placed over the heart and the following incantation spoken: ‘Amato Animo Animato Animagus.’\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The wait for the storm may take weeks, months or even years. During this time, the crystal phial should remain completely undisturbed and untouched by sunlight. Contamination by sunlight gives rise to the worst mutations. Resist the temptation to look at your potion until lightning occurs. If you continue to repeat your incantation at sunrise and sunset there will come a time when, with the touch of the wand\\-tip to the chest, a second heartbeat may be sensed, sometimes more powerful than the first, sometimes less so. Nothing should be changed. The incantation should be uttered without fail at the correct times, never omitting a single occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Immediately upon the appearance of lightning in the sky, proceed directly to the place where your crystal phial is hidden. If you have followed all the preceding steps correctly, you will discover a mouthful of blood\\-red potion inside it.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. It is essential to move, at once, to a large, secure place where your transformation cannot cause alarm or place you in physical danger. Place your wand\\-tip against your heart, speak the incantation 'Amato Animo Animato Animagus,’ and then drink the potion.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. If all has gone correctly, you will feel a fiery pain and an intense double heartbeat. Into your mind will come the shape of the creature into which you are shortly to transform. You must show no fear. It is too late, now, to escape the change you have willed.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The first transformation is usually uncomfortable and frightening. Clothing and items such as glasses or jewelry meld to the skin and become one with fur, scales or spikes. Do not resist and do not panic or the animal mind may gain the ascendancy and you could do something foolish, such as try to escape through a window or charge a wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. When your transformation is complete you should find yourself physically comfortable. You are strongly advised to pick up your wand at once and hide it in a place of safekeeping, where you will be able to find it when you regain a human form.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. To return to a human form, visualize your human self as clearly as you can. This should be sufficient, but do not panic if the transformation does not occur immediately. With practice, you will be able to slip in and out of your animal form at will, simply by visualizing the creature. Advanced Animagi can transform without wands.\n",

      "First of all, prior to the invention of the Wolfsbane potion, steps 1 and 2 would have been impossible since the werewolf form couldn't be controlled and at least one transformation would take place during the required period of time.  However if the Werewolf were to properly take the Wolfsbane Potion they would be able to keep their human mind and perform those steps.  None of the other steps would be impossible with or without the potion.    Once the Werewolf achieved an animagus form they should be able to simply transform into their animal form for the duration of the full moon instead of their werewolf form.\n",

      "Now as to why Lupin wouldn't have used this since he knew 3 successful animagi.  First of all, the entire reason for them becoming animagi was that the Wolfsbane potion did not exist while they were at school so he obviously couldn't have done it then.  Second of all, by the time that Wolfsbane had been created, James was dead, everyone thought that Peter was dead, and Sirius was in Azkaban so it wasn't like he could ask any of them for a step by step, and he may not have known exactly how they did it in the first place.

Harry picked him up, disregarding the countless times Ginny had told him not too (\"how will he learn to settle himself\" she would scold him, sounding more like Mrs Weasley than Harry's Ginny, not that he'd ever say *that* out loud). He held his son to his chest and felt his heart rate return to normal. Five full minutes of illicit cuddles and Harry was feeling more himself. Whatever his psychiatrist said this, this really was the medicine that helped most. Reminding himself that because of them, the brave warriors that stood in the face of inhuman darkness, the life's that were lost and the ones just barely clinging one, the ones who had watched their entire families die and still felt lucky to be alive, the ones that lost everything but were too young to understand why, the ones that looked at family members like heroes ignoring the amazing things they, themselves accomplished. Thanks to them and the untold suffering they still endured, James, his beautiful baby boy would life in a world free of constant threat and danger. He would attend Hogwarts and make friends and learn, attend banquets and visit Hagrid without worrying about who to trust or what evils lurked in the shadows.

However, while reading the books, I found myself more and more drawn to Slytherin—its values, reputation, history, characters.

      "* I would describe myself as a cautious person. I always prefer to make calculated decisions. I don’t like surprises or spontaneity. It may take me a long time to make a decision, but once I’ve made it, I am confident in my choice.\n",
      "* I value knowledge very highly and have the utmost respect for those who are highly educated. That being said, I cannot say that I chose to pursue my Master’s degree due to passion for the subject or a simple yearning to acquire more knowledge. My degree is in international business, which I view as a strategic choice. I know it will be useful to me in achieving my career goals. \n",
      "* Originality/individuality is also something I really value. I must admit, I tend to look down on those who blindly follow trends and can’t seem to think for themselves. I think this has to do with how much I value independence. I see these people, in a way, as people who can’t make decisions on their own. \n",
      "* I have a tremendous desire to be the “best”, or exceptional, at things, to a fault.\n",
      "* I consider myself to be quite family-oriented. As a person who has moved many times in my life, I have seen many friends come and go, but my family has always remained my constant. I would say, in general, I have always been the kind of person who doesn’t befriend or come to like many people, but the people I do care for, I care for deeply. I will always prefer deep, emotional ties to people over superficial ones. \n",

      "Honestly, after doing so much reflection, I can’t help but think—isn’t this proof enough that I’m a Ravenclaw? Yet something just doesn’t feel quite right. I feel dissatisfied.

It's really neat being able to just tap on a name or phrase or location within a book and have the wiki articles already loaded and available to view right there.\n",

You can see some of the annotations on my [xyAnnotations profile](https://annotations.xyfir.com/users/1).\n",

However, because it _is_ automated, there are some things that aren't quite right and I'd love to get some help improving the converted annotations. I need to do things like remove annotations that will never be highlighted within books, remove sections that are not relevant in the annotation format, fix searches so that more aliases are highlighted within books, and much more. Additionally, I also need help adding books, their covers, and their metadata to the xyAnnotations books database.\n",

We see that there are for sure two sports in OotP, when Harry is traveling through the Ministry of Magic: the Gobstones Club and, of course, Quidditch.  Gobstones is barely explained as a squirty, inky version of marbles.\\*  Quidditch however is interesting but the rules seem a bit arbitrary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rowling doesn't seem to put much stock in sports, that could be that she personally doesn't care for it or that it's unimportant to her story, but sports can be useful, as many have made the metaphor that football is war.  Much of the interhouse rivalry is cemented on Quidditch matches.  George Orwell after viewing one particularly disastrous football game said \n",

Wizard chess is normal chess but the pieces can move and talk by themselves and have some measure of autonomy (for example, Harry has to prod his pieces into moving).  Of course it might exist, but still.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also the Triwizard Tournament, which had been held on and off for centuries, but because of deaths, had ceased.  Unfortunately, we should see many more sports in the Wizarding World.  These are wizards who enchant literally everything and anything they can.  For them to be constrained by two sports seems a bit absurd when you consider [how many sports were invented in the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sports_originating_in_England).  Many cultures [have made all sorts of sports and leisure ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports)to occupy their time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Whereas you and I, as Muggles, devote a lot of time to mundane, seemingly unnecessary things such as traffic and travel, work, cooking, housework and cleaning, taking care of ourselves and our bodily functions, etc, wizards don't need to do most of that.  Most of their travel time is taken up by spells or Floo powder\\- long\\-distance travel notwithstanding.    Housework and cleaning can be done with the flip of a wand.  I'm guessing hair cuts, regular upkeep of your body, putting on makeup is also done by magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Work and food however are two very interesting situations.  Food cannot be whipped up out of thin air, it needs to have first been created and then vanished.  When you want it, then you must bring it back with a conjuring spell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Work, on the other hand, that seems useless in the Wizarding World.  Some people work because they love to work but don't have to, but most of us work because we need money for food, lodging, clothing: the necessities of life.  Wizards work, but they don't really need to.  They can live off the land.  They can build their own houses easily.  They can do things that Muggles couldn't easily do or we spend hours of our day doing.  The jobs that we see in the HP are usually related to some sort of institution.  Bill Weasley works at Gringotts; Arthur and Percy Weasley work at the Ministry of Magic; Harry, Ron, and Hermione also end up at the Ministry as Aurors and in Magical Law Enforcement respectively.  There are Healers, Dragonologists, Herbologists, Magizoologists, Quidditch players, Professors and Headmasters, housewives\\*, and entrepreneurs (as Fred and George did).  These are all very cool jobs, but we don't see many of the types of jobs that we have here in Muggle world: farmers, manufacturers, day laborers, plumbers, electricians, psychologists, secretaries, accountants, HR department, engineers, customer support, legal jobs, consultants, advertisers, managers, etc.  There are more bureaucratic and physical types of labor in our world than in the Wizarding World.\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrepreneurs, however, you have people who then start experimenting.  Aberforth Dumbledore did some illegal spells with a goat (probably other things too).  Fred and George Weasley spent much of their young adult years experimenting on themselves.  There are broommakers, wandmakers, apothecaries, potioneers and the like who spend their time and energy pushing the limits of magic.  In St. Mungo's, there is even a wing devoted to people who have had spells gone wrong on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, because wizards don't really need to have a job,\\*\\* there are all sorts of organizations in the Ministry of Magic that are needed to keep these other wizards in check such as the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, Department of Magical Transportation, the Department of Mysteries, and the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.\n",

      "*Leisure Class*\n",
      "\n",
      "With this, I turn to Thorstein Veblen, who wrote in 1899, *The Theory of the Leisure Class.*  For a quick primer, you can check out [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_the_Leisure_Class).  In it, he discusses many things, but his first point is on the structure of stratified society, which is based off the barbarian classes who would enter an area, conquer it, and create a division of labor where the higher classes spend their time performing acts of leisure and the lower classes doing the more productive work such as farming and manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also argues that many of the higher level jobs are high\\-status and unproductive.  The lower classes do all of the heavy lifting, making money in wages, compared to the higher level salaries.  Moreover, he states that there are tell\\-tale symptoms of this in the popularity of sports, devout observances, social formalities, and the subjugation of women and minority classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Leisure Class and the Wizarding World*\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, we see the rise of the leisure class constantly and consistently in HP.  You have a group of people with too much money and time on their hands, a la *The Magicians* by Lev Grossman.  If you could with the flick of your wrist get rid of all your chores and work, would you?  What would you do with your spare time?  Surf the internet? You can't because magic makes modern technology go haywire.  Read?  Make up new charms and spells?  Create a club?\\*  Explore the world?\n",
      "\n",
      "The stratified society would see either a surge in sports (but as we see Rowling devotes no time or energy or effort into it).  There are very little in terms of devout observances.  Wizards seem to have appropriated modern Muggle tendencies, such as Halloween, Christmas, Easter Break, etc.  There is no religion though. Social formalities are interesting as well.  Wizards don't seem to have many rules of etiquette except for purebloods.  We see the Gaunts have an unnatural amount of pride in their bloodline but there are little forms of etiquette otherwise.  No one apart from the Muggle\\-strong Dursleys tells Harry to sit up straight or comb his hair or look in someone's eyes when they're talking to them, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "We would see instead a surge in subjugation of women and minority classes.  Let's take, for example, Lucius Malfoy.  He has untold wealth by many accounts, most especially his son.  He has a house\\-elf to do his bidding and do even the most menial of tasks that he himself could do with the flick of his wrist.  What can he do with his time and energy?  We never really hear what he does.  He is on the Board of Governors and acts as a CEO but that cannot be taking up all his time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead he's devoted to the Dark Arts.  He spends his time and money and energy pushing the limits of Dark Magic.  It's interesting that it's usually the old, pureblood families are constantly thinking up ways to put down others. Of course, from a socio\\-economic perspective, this is why they're doing what they do. They usually have the most money (being from the older, conquering groups), but also have the most time and energy to think of ways to subjugate other groups into doing their bidding.  Their focus instead becomes in overcoming the Muggle world, but to do that, they need to overcome their Ministry and have the support of all wizards.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, you have a group of people who will push the boundaries of Dark Magic to their limit, leading to a vast need of Aurors.  Because of the amount of leisure time, you'll always have a class of people who will want to learn other types of magic, especially magic that puts them on top of others.  Durmstrang teaches Dark Arts and Hogwarts teaches Defense Against Dark Arts.  We don't have self\\-defense classes taught in school.  We shouldn't need to.\\*\\*  But they do because there are too many people with free time who begin to wonder to themselves, hey, what about doing this shady thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "\\*There are an innumerable amount of clubs from Slug Club to Dueling Club mentioned and omitted from Harry Potter.  OotP in particular mentions that all clubs would be disbanded, which would imply that there must be more than the one.

I believe this subject came up a few months ago, and if I remember, someone determined she was about 3 months older. For the life of me, I can't find that post, so maybe I'm hallucinating, but I started to think about it, and I think she should be more like 12 days older.\n",

      "Here's how I break it down, and please do correct me where there are errors:\n",
      "\n",
      "An example Hogwarts schedule gives 7 periods per day, 45 minutes per period. Ron and Harry take 9 subjects, which presumably is a normal, full load. Hermione is taking all 12. The schedule has variable days with alternating double periods, so it is easiest to calculate based on a weekly average. So 7 periods per day, 5 days per week gives 35 periods per week. With 9 subjects over 35 periods, that is 3.89 periods/subject/week. At 45 minutes per period, you get an average of 2.92 hours/subject/week. Hermione has 3 classes in excess of Ron and Harry, so 3 subjects x 2.92 hrs/subject/week gives 8.75 excess hours per week during the weeks she took all 3 extra classes, and 5.84 excess hours per week after April when she dropped Divination. \n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming for the school year about 36 weeks of active class time (52 \\- about 16 weeks for breaks and holidays, best guess, I don't really know about the UK school calendar), she took three extra classes for 28 weeks and two extra classes for maybe 8 weeks, she would have accumulated:  (28 weeks x 8.75 hrs/week) \\+ (8 weeks x 5.84 hrs/week) = 245 extra hours. With 24 hours per day and 291.72 extra hours, she would be 12.16 days older at the end of the school year. \n",

      "This was a fun exercise, but I'm sure I made some blaring errors, so please help me out! \n",
      "So I have a question about Moody's eye. I'm doing a full series reread as I do every couple of years and I'm currently on GoF.

I'm watching POA tonight and as soon as Fred and George showed up, it made me realise how much I dislike the film versions of these guys.

      "In the books, Harry and his friends are under constant threat of expulsion from the school. Expulsion from school before you turn 17 is essentially banishment from the wizarding world. They snap your wand in half and you are banned from using magic ever again. You presumably can't go to another school or be re-admitted into Hogwarts; you're just done. Forever.  For crimes that almost always turn out to be mischief, before you're a legal adult. In the US, most minors under 18 who commit crimes go to juvenile detention centers, and are generally released with a sealed record when they turn 18. A fresh start (obvious issues with this system aside). In the wizarding world, being up out of bed a few too many nights is punishable by banishment from the world in all but name. Sure, you can still hang out in the wizarding world, but you're essentially a Squib, and Squibs tend to blend in with muggles more often than not. \n",

      "Fast forward to real-life justice system. Heavy crimes are tried before the Wizengamot, which is a highly politicized judge, jury, and executioner system.

There is apparently an appeals process for trials, but it seems like the Wizengamot's decisions are final. \n",

      "Finally, Azkaban. An island prison guarded by manifestations of emotional and mental torture.  Presumably all solitary confinement, with little contact with the outside world or your fellow prisoners. The prison apparently sucks the life out of its prisoners; life expectancy isn't long once you're there. Guards have the ability to impose a worse-than-death condition upon you. The worst part? This seems to be the only prison wizards have. While all crimes are bad, we don't throw muggers in supermax prisons. Any prolonged exposure to Dementors is already too much punishment for most crimes. \n",

And then this occasion where Harry fixes his old wand with “Reparo” is the last spell we hear in the books. Maybe I’m wrong and I missed a spell, or maybe this has been pointed out before, but this is the first time I noticed it and I’m really excited.

We drive quite a bit, and I am kicking around the idea of getting the audio books and listening to them as a family while we travel.  I’ve read the books (on my second read through now) and think she would enjoy learning of the additional storylines and characters not mentioned in the movies.  I’m not saying my daughter is a genius or anything of that nature, but her comprehension and critical thinking is pretty exceptional for a child her age.

I am re-reading the series and picturing the Dursleys being in their early 20s at the start of Book 1 is practically impossible for me.

In the book, it's a very big deal about how Harry is the first, first-year, to ever play.  I very much enjoyed both the movies and the book so far, so this isn't a quip - only curious if anyone may know a reason behind this.

You could even go much further back, but I think it would be best to at least initially stay within the time lines of the books released so far. This way the characters are familiar, but new or fleshed out more.\n",
      "So last night I was trying to decide what the saddest part of the whole series was for me. In the movies it’s easily the death of Cedric Diggory – the “that’s my boy” line gets to me every single time – then I got thinking about the book and Cedric Diggory is definitely a strong contender but then suddenly I remembered this small scene in OOTP and the more I thought about it the more it broke my heart.\n",
      " It’s just after Sirius died, Harry is back in Hogwarts and he went looking for Nearly Headless Nick to ask about how people become ghosts. At first, I thought this conversation was so sad because Harry is just so grief stricken and desperate to hold on to Sirius in some way and when Nick says that Sirius isn’t gonna become a ghost it’s one of, I think, many moments where Harry is faced with the fact Sirius is gone completely and for good. \n",
      "And then I started to think about Nick in this scene and I started to feel really sad for him in a way that I never have before. Firstly, Nick has been expecting this conversation since he found out Sirius died, and he made it sound (if I’m remembering it right) that he’s had this same conversation with other students before, probably a bunch of times. \n",
      "Secondly, he can’t tell them what they want to hear. He doesn’t get to tell them that there’s no way for their loved ones to remain as ghosts (again, if I’m remembering right), he has to tell them that they theoretically could, but they wouldn’t. I think it’s got to be such a hard thing for Harry to hear that the only family he’s got wouldn’t choose to stay with him – and that’s not a criticism of Sirius because I wouldn’t either, but it is sad. \n",
      "I think in that moment we get a glimpse of Nick’s feelings about his own life. Generally, we see Nick as a pretty upbeat ghost (esp compared to moaning myrtle, the red baron, Ravenclaw’s daughter whose name escapes me); he’s got a great relationship with the students and staff, he has a large group of friends (as seen in his death day party), he has ambitions (joining the headless hunt), but here we get to see that this existence also causes him to suffer and that’s never going to get better for him. From what I can tell once you become a ghost you stay a ghost. \n",
      "I haven’t read the books in a few months so I might not be remembering this scene perfectly and the books are at my boyfriend’s house atm so I can’t check so please forgive me if I’m wrong.

If they accept and survive, which less than 1 in 4 who accept do, the phoenix chooses them as their master and follows them until the end of their days. For example, Dumbledore earns Fawkes's loyalty by dueling Grindelwald even though victory seems for him impossible, due to Grindelwald's possession of the elder wand. Phoenixes do not understand the complexities of life, and so accepting their call may be unwise. However, if one does, one will likely spend the rest of one's days wondering if one did the right thing or if one merely made excuses to avoid facing one's fears. \n",

He'd listened to the screams of the wounded, in the armies he'd raised to defend the innocent; young wizards of courage had rallied to his calls, and he'd buried them afterward. Until finally, when his wizardry had only just begun to fail him in his old age, he'd brought together the three other most powerful wizards of his era to raise Hogwarts from the bare ground; the one great accomplishment to Godric's name that wasn't about war, any kind of war, no matter how just.

If it had been the right thing for him to do, then he wouldn't tell anyone else to choose wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts.

      "\n",
      "Built in defences: Spell proof to any damage attempted, parseltongue required to open, gave Trio magical low blood sugar/hypo-depression whenever worn.  Insecurity fuelled nightmare projection as last defence when actually opened: 7/7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Damage done: Tried to choke Harry when he got too close to Gryffindor sword, pushed Ron away from Trio when worn: 2/7, it was mostly an inconvenience once they got it from the Ministry.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3.) The Ring: \n",

      "Damage done: Basically gave Dumbledore a timer, made him plan assisted suicide with Snape: 6/7, full potential of the curse was held back pretty easily by Snape.\n",

      "\n",
      "Built in defences: Hypothetical, but the ring's defences were probably there for anyone who tried to wear it: 2/7, no one wore it but there was a heightened chance of Malfoy or company randomly trying it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Damage done: None, it didn't put up much of a fight: 0/7, went up in smoke.\n",

Sometimes hung directly on Voldemort's shoulders: 5/7, didn't need to hide much of the time, was stealthy when wanted to be.\n",

And not one mention of it being used on anyone that was under the Unbreakable Vow. So I was wondering what would happen. Would the Unbreakable Vow allow them to lie just for what was questioned, or would they die if they admitted to what they promised to do? Anyone have any ideas?‬\n",

To which Hermoine replied, _It's about the Weasley's bloodline. What about it?_ asked Harry. _Have you ever thought about why Ron have so many siblings and only One Sister?_ _No, I didn't,_ answered Harry. *The Weasley bloodline is the Purest in the history of the Wizarding world, so pure that it is even mentioned in Hogwarts a History as the only family who have blessed the Hogwarts with purity of magic blood. Something which even Slytherins can't achieve. The Weasley Bloodline is a book in itself  hidden it the library of Hogwarts out of the reach of most students. Every Weasley generation requires at least one girl and one boy child. The Weasley generation only expects balance and do not wish for an Ideal boy child.*\n",

Mr. Weasley said, *_for the blood_* to which everyone said together except Ginny, *_for the blood_* . And Ginny Screamed in a thick voice with her mascara spread all over her face under her eyes. *DO IT.*\n",

      "Hi there - this is my first time posting on this subreddit so I’m hoping this is an okay place to ask this. So, many years ago in the early stages of the movie franchise there used to be a fan site called Sherbet Lemon (or something similar - it *was* a very long time ago). From memory, it was mostly a site for fan-made videos. There is one in particular I remember that I would like to track down. It was set to the song ‘Hair’ from the musical of the same name and featured clips of characters with amazing hair (e.g. Lucius Malfoy). I’m pretty sure this video was made in between the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire since it only had clips from the first three movies. \n",

      "Don't get me wrong, I'm on board with it but I wish they kind of knocked some other stuff out of the way, or honestly added to the part of Islands of Adventure that was made.

There was all sorts of cool games, shops and food in that area that got demolished, and it's cool to see Gringotts but Jaws is timeless, even 40 years later and that whole place had a nostalgic vibe to it that really should have been kept up for many more years. \n",

Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can’t work out who she likes best. Then she’ll be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that’s all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she’s afraid she’s going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she’s been flying so badly.”\n",

      "Hermione also sees the initial signs that Harry's opinion of Ginny had changed and he was falling for her so it seems Hermione is very good at recongising the emotions in others when she can be a bit more dispassionate about it, and she is pretty good at recongising her own emotions as she realised before Ron her feelings for Ron (based on an interview with JKR) as Hermione was well aware she wanted to date Ron in GoF. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where Hermione fails though is she is bad at recongising others feelings when she is too close to the topic, and too emotionally involved, hence her not realising Ron's feelings for her, and she is also bad with the emotions of others if she is trying to prove a point such as when Hermione was very insensitive about Lavender's dead rabbit simply because Hermione was trying to prove a point.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I would argue Hermione can't be the most emotionally intelligent and that the most emotionally intelligent is Luna as while Luna is certainly rather odd at times she actually seems very good at reading people and she is also capable of being surprisingly insightful with her comments. She also never seems to make people uncomfortable in terms of insensitive comments and she also seems very aware of her own emotions and does not have a problem expressing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The least emotionally intelligent, it has to be one of Draco, Harry or Ron but I am sort of discounting Ron as while he can be very insensitive he was able to figure out reasonably quickly that he liked Hermione, and when someone was properly upset he was usually sensitive enough to try and make them feel better. Then it is between Harry and Draco, something that is very tough as Harry is very emotionally dumb, taking forever to realise his feelings for Ginny and also being very uncomfortable with the emotions of others, much preferring to avoid people who are struggling emotionally than trying to help. Draco on the other hand is so self absorbed he either doesn't recognise the emotions of others, or does not care. I suspect though that in order to be a good bully he does need some emotional intelligence since he needs to reocognise the sore spots in the people he is bullying. So I am going to go with Harry, just.\n",

I personally did not like the Cursed Child at all, but through all the faults, one of the pieces that irked me the most was Harry saying, \"Well, there are times I wish you weren't my son.\" It's just so extremely out of character for him, I feel like. Of course all parents make mistakes, and he did say it out of impulse, but I just find it so unlikely for him to even think of something along those words.

Half Blood Prince built him up for a nice redemption arc, showing him more as a tragic character that's a product of his family opposed to someone who truly wants to be evil. Someone on this sub noted that his wand is in fact unicorn hair, one of the most difficult to corrupt, so they clearly did a number on him. That being said, his story in Deathly Hallows just sort of, ended. There's no Draco payoff except a nod at the train station. Cursed Child does an interesting full-circle by returning Draco back to his immediate family's one redeeming quality: they do, in their own relatively twisted way, love their children. Quite blatantly Voldemort would not have been defeated if it wasn't for Narcissa lying (and risking her life) to save Draco. And Draco brings a bit of this back in Cursed Child. Is it a full arc? No. But it's something. \n",

I've spent hours reading about the differences of the houses, trying to find new tests, retaking tests every few days based on moods I'm in and whatnot in the hopes of finding some correlation but can't really nail down where I'd properly belong. Here are some of my qualities:\n",
      "\n",
      "-I can be fairly judging of people at first; almost standoffish. However, if we become friends, it's a practically unbreakable relationship\n",
      "\n",
      "-When faced with a decision, I often analyse it in detail - trying to find the best avenue of approach. I weigh the pros and cons, which would grant the best benefits, etc. Even when making fast and quick decisions, I usually still considering the overall outcome\n",
      "\n",
      "-I tend to be critical. As of member of the military, I often jump on peoples mistakes when they make them. Sometimes I'm passive aggressive, sometimes I'm more direct. I even do this to some people who are close to me. I don't have patience for stupid mistakes or stupid questions. Sometimes I end up insulting people indirectly and haven't really realised it was an insult to begin with until after it was said. I don't consider myself a cruel person at all - most would describe me as a very down to earth person; I just tend to be direct and honest and up front about things. \n",
      "\n",
      "-I love to joke around; particularly with dry humour and silly one-liners. However, when it's time to get serious, I have no problem getting down to business. However, I'm always that guy who says \"This could be worse...\". \n",
      "\n",
      "-Sometimes I let emotion impact my daily life. For example, if I had a fight with my significant other, I end up usually taking that poor attitude to the workplace and many of my coworkers notice when something is going on with me personally, though I never usually go into detail unless theyre one of my most trusted friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "-I value hard work. I believe hard work would fix the majority of peoples problems and hard work will ALWAYS beat talent in the end. I don't care if somebody is the best at something, if I see real effort, that's all that matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "-When I get a hobby, I tend to become almost obsessed with it. Whether it's working out, boxing, Harry Potter, Comics, Star Wars or whatever, I find myself spending hours browsing the internet just looking for more information on it and how I can get overall better at it if it's an activity. I've spent many hours just looking at different superpowers. I don't think \"this would be cool to have\", I think \"which one would be the most useful in day to day life and would overall help my quality of life.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "-As a member of the military, I'd give anything for my Country and family. Sometimes its hard, but I put my head down and push through it and know things will get better. Also, I try to further my career as much as I can - taking any extra courses I can, trying to be more fit, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "-I value company of friends, and do enjoy socialising and have no issues in conversation. However, I do enjoy being alone - whether that's going for a hike by myself, seeing a movie alone or just spending time watching TV in my room.\n",
      "\n",
      "-I write fairly often; whether about my feelings, activities ongoing in my life or what have you. I like to document my life through writing and also video when travelling. I like to show people my travels in a creative way. With regards to my writing, I would like to give it to children if i have them or a significant other.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Lastly, I consider myself a practical person overall. I can't stand clutter and dirtiness in a living area. That isn't to say I don't mind getting dirty - I'll do what it takes to get the job done. I'm very much a \"everything has its place\" kind of guy. Everybody comments how my apartment or car is always so clean and tidy. I don't believe in buying things if it doesn't have a purpose; though I also splurge on things but only if they contribute to a hobby.

She is traditional enough to follow the \"norm\" at first and goes to meet the matchmaker to become a bride and bring honor to her family.

There is even an episode where she lectures the Genie about sportsmanship and fair play. She no longer puts herself first but sacrifices herself not only for her own people but allows herself to become a hostage at another kingdom so the prince there won't punish his people. Jasmine also seems to want to help her kingdom more and particuarly focuses on the poor and lackage of food. But she also displays more cunning in a couple of episodes. In another episode, she outsmarts and defeats Mozenrath (or what his name was) after he traps Aladdin and mocks her for being a princesses. We also gets to see her as a thief at some point and unlike Aladdin, Jasmine didn't seem to hold the \"Steal only what you need\" thing as she steals a full coin bag from a man rather than just food.

      "\n",
      "1)\tWhy did Voldemort direct him to become DADA professor? Folks might think because he wanted Quirrell positioned at Hogwarts to steal the stone. But that’s wrong – Quirrell had already had the job before the stone was put there. We know that because Hagrid introduces Harry to Quirrell on the day they go to Diagon Alley – later that day Quirrell attempts to steal the stone from Gringotts. So he must have had the job lined up before he knew the stone would end up at Hogwarts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps we can brush this one off, assuming that Voldemort simply wanted access to Hogwarts more broadly once he got the stone to position himself closer to Harry or Dumbledore. So he sent his host to teach there. Except. . . \n",
      "\n",
      "2)\tThe DADA job was jinxed by Voldemort. So he knew that Quirrell wouldn’t have lasted more than a year there. Maybe Voldemort figured that a year was better than nothing? \n",
      "\n",
      "Or maybe Voldemort lifted the jinx for Quirrell? If that’s the case then. \n",
      "\n",
      "3)\tThis was actually mean that Quirrell didn’t last one year as DADA professor because of the jinx, but because of bad luck, or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, it’s also possible that: \n",
      "\n",
      "4)\tVoldemort doomed himself to fail to get the stone by positioning Quirrell as DADA professor when the job had a jinx on it. Had Quirrell succeeded, he could have remained professor there for more than a year. But the jinx wouldn’t have allowed that to happen. Therefore, the jinx may have been working in Harry’s favor and in weird subtle ways helped him defeat Quirrell, therefore upholding the jinx. \n",
      "\n",
      "Incidentally, the same could be said about Barty Crouch Jr. Although his plan was to conclude before the end of the term, the jinx wouldn’t have known that, and may have been working in subtle ways to help Harry uncover Crouch as a fake-Moody and therefore ensure that he couldn’t have remained a professor for more than year. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think this probably reveals how the jinx, more broadly, is a problematic magical concept. There are an infinite number of ways in which a person could end up out of a job and lots of variation that could have kept them there, despite what magical obstacles might persist. It’s unclear to me how a bit of magic could ensure that someone only lasts a year in a job. But I know, it’s magic. Just saying! \n",

      "So in GoF we know that he leant the map to \"Moody\" and the he used it to make sure no one discovered him/he could move around discreetly. At the emd of the book he mentions to Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagal that he used the map during the interrogation. After the interrogation Harry is sent to the hospital wing and the book proceeds to end. We never hear about the map again until Chapter 18 of OotP when the trio uses the map to scope out the Room of Requirement. So my question is, when/how does Harry get the map back?\n",
      "I want a full on Harry Potter theme park. Not just at Universal. I want it to start at King's Cross and it uses VR goggles to make you think there's a wall to platform 9 3/4s when there's not really. Then you can take the train to Hogwarts. You can go all over the grounds. See a Quidditch game and cheer on your house in the Quidditch grounds, go in the forbidden forest. You can sleep overnight in your house's common room like a hotel. Meanwhile, the theme park also has Godric's Hollow, Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley (which you have to get to by using \"floo powder\"), Knockturn Alley, maybe even the Burrow, Ministry of Magic, and Privet Drive. There's rides there like the ones in Universal, but you can actually live at Hogwarts for a while like how you can get immersed at a renaissance festival. Dine in the Great Hall, go to the bathroom and hear moaning myrtle. Attend classes, like defence against the dark arts, potions. Gain points for your house but completing challenges or doing well in Harry Potter trivia OWL exams. The staircases move around. Etc\n",

      "Basilisk Heartstring: This is the polar opposite of Phoenix feather, since Fawkes was able to blind the Basilisk of Salazar Slytherin, it would make sense, wands of this core can easily aligning itself with the user; HOWEVER, it complies with users who possess great power or talent in magic, giving them much higher access to new fields of magic, especially dark magic It is rumored when using a wand with this core for a good amount of years of experience, it has additional effects for using the three Unforgivable Curses (e.g. when using Crucio, it increases the power by double, when using Imperio, gives the user longer time to control the victim’s mind, Avada Kadavra can be more powerful and painful to the victim). Overall, it is stereotyped that it accepts wizards who are evil in the making or ones that love to cause mischief, but there are some good wizards with wands of that core who would do great things with it. I think Gellert Grindelwald would’ve been a great example for it, so would Voldemort as a replacement for the elder wand. Maybe if Loki was in the Harry Potter universe he would use that wand as well. \n",

      "Werewolf fur: wands with this core are known to like fearsome wizards and witches, but it can sometimes change its alignment when picked by another wizard/witch, just like how werewolves change forms every full moon. It is said that whoever masters wands with this core can produce powerful  transfiguration spells patronuses with enough years of experience. \n",

      "Mermaid Hair: Wands with Mermaid hair core are said to possess amazing light magic properties, it has amazing effects massive power when using water and ice type spells, but somehow weak when using fire based spells, but compensates it for its good use of Conjuration spells. The core also shares interesting adaptability to kind hearted yet unique individuals, also ones with wizards and witches who share the sensitive side of their emotions as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Succubus fang: Amazing wand core for advanced memory charms, advanced jinxes and its good potential for dark magic, has an interesting hypnotizing effect when using the Imperio Curse (since its mind control and succubuses hypnotize their victims). It is stereotyped that its users are mainly Dark Witches for its aforementioned traits\n",

Since both Harry and Voldemort have the same wand core, not to mention Phoenix feather can give the user access to a higher variety of magic. So, if indeed Voldemort was able to make Harry his protege in secrecy like how Emperor Palpatine did with Anakin in Star Wars, maybe Harry would be able to overthrow Voldemort and take his place as the new Dark Lord, with Hermione and Ron as his right hand people. Hermione is books-smart, which means she can provide Harry with new information on potions, spells and magical creatures too.

      "I know many people dislike time travel part in the third HP book. I've been wondering why. What is wrong with such a plot device? Also, how does this particular time travel thing work in Rowling's story? Is it right to say that Harry and Hermione do not change the future, but fulfill something that has already happened?\n",
      "James and Sirius both grew up in pure blood families. Sirius obviously didn't believe in pure blood supremacy. But both of them were taught that werewolves are dangerous and should be shunned. So how did they manage to ignore what they've been taught and accept Remus and remaind his friends? The episode in POA shows that even Ron doesn't trust Lupin after learning he's a werewolf (\"get away from me,werewolf\").\n",
      "Hmm there are 13 subjects that Hermione had taken at the start of the 3rd year or something? What subject that she taken? help me pls...\n",
      "\"What we need,\" said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, \"is more time.\"\n",
      "\"But-\" Hermione began. Her eyes became very round. \"OH!\"\n",
      "Harrys attention began to wander as Dumbledore explained to Hermione something that was clearly beyond his intelligence. He thought back to the night when his parents were brutally murdered in front of him. He had been thinking about that a lot of late, due to the Dementor attacks; and the person who was once in the background of his reminiscing was now the one he thought of most: Voldemort. At first it had been his parents he had focused on, but the more Harry thought about the scene, the more Voldemort captured his attention, and the feelings that were growing inside him began to erupt in a passionate fire. \n",
      "Hermione pulled out a fine gold chain from neck of her robes, and Harry became aware that they were now alone in the hospital wing; save for Ron who was sound asleep in the bed beside them. \n",
      "\"Wait,\" he said, thinking back on the conversation he had been only half listening to. \"Does this mean we can go back in time by turning that necklace?\" \n",
      "\"Yes,\" Hermione replied breathlessly, \"It was a present from Professor McGonagall. Its how i've been getting to all my classes.\"\n",
      "she hesitated in placing the time-turner around them when she saw the glint that had just appeared in his eye. \n",
      "\"What is it?\" \n",
      "Harrys mind was racing. If that piece of jewelry controlled time then he could essentially do anything with no consequences, so long as he went back in time afterwards. He hesitated only a tender moment before sliding his hand under his robe. \n",
      "\"Wh-what are you doing?\" Hermione asked timidly. \"We need to hurry, the dementors could be subjecting Sirius to the kiss at any moment now.\" \n",
      "\"On the contrary\" Harry said as he began to lower his robe slowly, \"We have all the time in the world.\" \n",
      "Hermiones eyes widened and she backed away a step. \n",
      "\"we need to save Sirius. Stop it its not funny. Wha-\" \n",
      "\"Petrificus Totalus!\" Harry cried, after whipping out his wand. Hermione froze in mid sentence and began to fall forwards. Harry leapt towards her and caught her, letting his robes fall off in the process. He smiled when he saw that her mouth was frozen wide open, and her eyes were moving around the room in shock, as though she was silently pleading with him. He pushed up against her now-still body, and felt his pulsating erection pressing against her waist. He slowly took off her robes and then undergarments, savouring the moment. \n",
      "As he stripped away her last scrap of clothing he leaned back slightly to fully examine her body. She was far from perfect, with her pale skin and rather bushy underarm hair; but for the moment she was all Harrys, and that was almost enough to make him ejaculate on the spot. \n",
      "He lowered her on her back so that she was facing the ceiling, and began to sink himself over her so that his balls were just barely touching her mouth. He could faintly hear a \"mmph!\" Sound coming from her, but it was so muffled by the power of the curse that it was barely audible. He then proceeded to dip his balls into her mouth over and over again like a teabag into warm milk. He increased the speed steadily; trying to resist the temptation to stimulate his throbbing penis through masturbation. A drop of pre-cum oozed out of the end of his phallas and dripped down his shaft to his ball sack, where it dropped into Hermiones frozen mouth. After several minutes of this Harry found he just could not take the strain on his thighs. Sweat was dripping from every gland and he was having even more trouble seeing than usual because of the moisture in his eyes. He dunked his scrotum into Hermiones gaping orifice one last time before getting to his feet shakily and moving towards her waist. \n",
      "He lay on top of her in missionary position and began to slowly insert his sex into her holy temple, closing his eyes with bliss as he felt it slide through the various bits and pieces that made up her womanhood. He felt it slide half-way in before hitting a firm surface. Her maidenhead! \n",
      "He slid backwards and then proceeded to slam into her as hard as he could repeatedly, ignoring her muffled screams, until he felt it break open. After he was inside her he found that he could not take it any longer, and spilled his seed inside her with shudders of pleasure. \n",
      "He lay on top of her for half a minute before rising to his feet shakily. He removed the time-turner from Hermiones hand and examined it carefully. A thought had came to him, more terrible and alluring than the idea of raping Hermione. He placed the time turner around his neck and began turning it, after wiping the blood from his shaft. He stood for what seemed like hours, turning the necklace. He passed his first day of Hogwarts, then his 11th birthday, then his first sexual encounter with Vernon Dursley; which was too graphic to be mentioned here.\n",
      "Eventually he reached the day of his parents death. It was winter; the snow was falling harder than he had plowed Hermiones gutter. It was clearly Halloween; there were people travelling to and from various places wearing masks and outfits of all kinds of ridiculous sorts, but Harrys eyes were only for the house in front of him. He could see his mother through the mirror clearly; her figure silhouetted through the thin curtains. \n",
      "Harry walked around to the side of the house, searching for a way inside without his parents hearing him. He eventually reached a high bathroom window which was slightly ajar; and it took little effort to squeeze his scrawny body through it and out the other side. He hid in the linen cupboard next to him and waited.\n",
      "It took little time before he heard the sound of the front door creaking open, and his father yelling something to his mother. He heard a high, cold laugh that made the back of his neck stand up, before a cry and a blast of green light. At the sounds of Harrys fathers body hitting the ground he rose from the cupboard and walked into the lounge room. He could se the hem of Voldemorts robes disappear up the stairs, and followed him quietly behind. As he entered his old bedroom he was met with one of the most strangely erotic sights he had ever seen. There on the floor in front of him was his mothers dead body, but he was only half aware of it. What caught the majority of his attention was the baby in the cot at the far side of the room. It was him. Voldemort was standing in front of the crib, jerking off into the boys face.\n",
      "\"You know you can really damage a boy's eyesight by doing that\" said Harry as he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. Voldemort leapt into the air in shock; almost catching his foreskin in the ceiling fan. \n",
      "\"Oh Harry,\" he panted, gazing him up and down \"My you've grown, you look just like your father\" \n",
      "he breathed huskily while gazing at Harry's unbuttoned fly. \n",
      "\"Let's finish this the way you always wanted\" Said Harry and strode over to Voldermort. He looked him right in the eyes like he was looking down the barrel of a gun. \n",
      "\"Just you, me…and me\" \n",
      "They both simultaneously turned their heads to the infant Harry sitting innocently in his crib like a baby deer right for the raping.\n",
      "\"Oh, my word you really are a potter aren't you\" whispered The Dark Lord excitedly. \n",
      "Before Harry could say another word Voldemort had his body up against him and was kissing him with the passion of two phoenix's locked in a fiery embrace. Harry sucked on Voldemorts bald forehead like it was a scrumptious ghost drop, and Voldemort closed his eyes and sighed in blissful ecstasy. Harry tore Voldemorts robes off with a dramatic twirl, and they pressed closer as they made out with an intensity that would put a world class game of chess to shame. Harry became aware that his robes had been removed as well, but how or when he did not know. He just assumed it could be attributed to Voldemorts dark powers. \n",
      "Voldemort worked his mouth down to Harrys neck, and Harry turned towards baby Harry, who was trying to get out of the cot and run away. \n",
      "\"Not so fast.\" gasped Harry seductively, and he grabbed baby Harry from the manger and lifted him in the air. Voldemort stopped sucking Harrys neck and looked at baby Harry with an expression of pure lust on his white face. Harry removed baby Harrys diaper, ignoring his screams and cries as he tried to squirm away. Harry then moved the baby down towards his waist and forced his penis into the babys crying, gaping mouth. Voldemort drifted behind the adolescent Harry and inserted his love wand into Harrys anus, groaning softly in euphoria as he did so. Baby Harrys screams were muffled by Harrys shaft being forcefully shoved in and out of his throat, and Harry moaned loudly as he felt his pre cum ooze from the end of his glans. He was close to climax, but he knew he had to savour this moment. He was hardly aware of the burning pain in his asshole as Voldemort penetrated him over and over again with the force of a jackhammer. He heard Voldemort let out a high scream and felt his rectum fill to the brim with thick white man-gravy. The electricity between the three was so strong that a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt was being magically cut into the baby Harrys forehead.\n",
      "Voldemort gave Harry one last hump before removing his manhood from inside Harry. Harry could feel the sperm and blood oozing out of his asshole as Voldemort slid his steaming semen roadway from Harrys love hole. Harry pulled the baby Harry from his genitalia and pushed his pinky finger into baby Harrys anus. The fit was painfully tight, and this was clearly baby Harrys first intimate encounter. \n",
      "Voldemort pointed his wand at his scrotum and \"sperma replere!\" he rasped as his saggy white nut bag inflated with a fresh batch of sticky juice. Such were the powers of the dark lord. Harry squeezed his second finger into the babys crap-hole, feeling it rip to support the size of two slender, nuckle-deep, adolescent fingers. He was aware of a trickle of blood and watery shit oozing down his wrist, and bent to lick himself clean again. Voldemort took Harrys lead by entering Harry with two fingers; but upon feeling how loose Harry was (a result of Vernon Dursleys work), he added a third finger, and then a fourth. Twisting and turning his hand to increase the room, Voldemort pushed his entire fist into Harrys anus and began to fist-fuck Harry with the ferocity of a werewolf. Pumping with such enthusiasm. \n",
      "\"My word\" panted Harry in a pleasure shutter \"Looks like this won't be the only scar i receive tonight\" He said as he seductively stroked his forehead. \n",
      "This only enraged the lusty fire burning deep in The Dark Lords loins as he brought in a second fist up Harrys pleasure hole. Harry let out a soft wail similar to that of a baby dolphin lost in the ocean looking for its mother. Voldemort wept a tear of pure joyness as the infant Harry just screamed in agony as Harry inserted a third finger. Voldemort was now up to his elbows with both arms inside Harry, and working his way deeper. The infant Harry vomited all over the floor as Harry twisted his fingers around inside him. Voldemort was now up to his shoulders, and he stretched them out in order to increase the size of Harrys brown hole. \n",
      "Harry removed his fingers and forced his main vein into the infant Harrys asshole, ignoring the gurgles and high screams that emerged from his mouth. Voldemort now had his head inside Harry as well, and Harry could feel him licking the walls of his intestines savagely. Harry could feel blood vessels popping in his veiny shaft as he thrusted the baby harder than he had ever thrusted anything in his life. Voldemort was now waist deep inside Harry and trying to get out. He tried to grab at the cheeks but they were too slippery, and despite his best efforts he was sliding forwards. Harry was too busy fucking the now limp baby in his hands to pay any attention, and Voldemorts screams were muted by the deep chasm that was Harrys body. With a final suctioning noise Voldemorts entire body disappeared into Harry, never to be seen again until his famous return to life in Harrys 4th year at Hogwarts. Harry finally spurted his last ounce of blood-mixed semen inside the infant and almost fainted out of pure happiness.\n",
      "After a few moments of collecting himself he placed the baby Harry inside the cot.\n",
      "\"Scourgify!\" he cried, cleaning up the blood, shit and sperm from the bedroom floor. After one last look around the room, he fled through the open window and disappeared into the night. Looking back, he silently gave a prayer for the baby Harry in the crib; knowing that the next 11 years would be very hard for him. Life in the Durleys was hard… Very hard.\n",

      "When I think about Voldemort and all the horrible things he did in his life, I break it up into two separate reigns of terror. The pre Harry era and the Harry era we read in the books. The question I’m asking is which of those two reigns was overall more deadly, destructive, terrifying, whatever you want to call it. I feel a case could be made for either side. Personally speaking I fall into the pre Harry era. This was the era when Voldemort rose to power and became one of the worlds most famous (or infamous) wizards. Establishing a fear of his name, becoming all powerful, and creating horcruxes are all valid arguments. I’m curious to hear if anybody disagrees or perhaps agrees but has further points to add. \n",

      "I have a question about the age of Dumbledore in the new upcoming movie Fantastic Beasts the Crimes of Grindewald. Don't you think seeing flashbacks of Dumbledore in HP COS and in HBP that the actor playing Dumbledore is way too young in the upcoming movie? Because it is during the time of Voldemort his hogwarts years, right? \n",

      "I have seen many posts now arguing over whether the Deathly Hallows or the Death  Eaters Mark is closer related to the swastika and whether Grindelwald or Voldemort is closer related to Hilter. I thought I would give my opinion on the debate since I first read the Harry Potter series I saw a direct correlation instantly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Undeniably JK Rowling intended for her books to be believable and to reflect our muggle everyday life and she has admitted such in interviews. She has used many historical references in her books, whether is was immorality, witchcraft, etc. If we know anything about JK Rowling we know she does not just throw anything into her writing, everything is well thought out. WWII had a major impact on Britain and on the US and I believe she drew inspiration from both perspectives. She has also not shied away from political debates in both. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would argue that the Death Eaters Mark is closer to a swastika than the Deathly Hallows due to the direct correlation between Voldemort and Hitler. Here are a few brief similarities I have noticed: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Purity -  Both were concerned with racially purifying the human race and racial ideology. Hilter believed the Aryan race was the superior race while Voldemort believed Purebloods were superior. Hilter had a hierarchy of races with Aryan being at the top and Jews being at the bottom. Voldemort also had a hierarchy where Purebloods were at the top and Muggles and Mudbloods were at the bottom. Hilter and his followers looked down upon those who were sympathetic to Jews even if they were of the Aryan race and in later years of the war would send them to the camps with the Jews. Voldemort and his Death Eaters looked down upon Pureblood families who were sympathetic to Mudbloods and Muggles such as the Weasley family. It is reasonable to believe that if Voldemort got as far along in his plans that he would also have treated families such as the Weasleys with such distaste.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Despised their own Family Heritage - It is wide known that Hilter was jewish himself (I believe from his father’s side) and DNA evidence of his living relatives has proved such. Voldemort was a half-blood himself from his father’s side. Both surrounded themselves with people of the ideological race they praised but neither would meet their own criteria if held to their own standards. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Symbols - The swastika was adopted as the Nazi party emblem and was used on all Nazi propaganda. The emblem could be seen on their flags flown in the sky and on the Nazi’s armbands which they would wear on their left arm. Voldemort’s Death Eater symbol would fly high in the sky similar to the Nazi flag and his Death Eaters wore their Death Eater Mark on their left arms. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Hoods - While the KKK is not directly linked with Hitler and his Nazi party since they were established well before WWII, they do claim to have the same beliefs and idolize what Hilter was able to accomplish and stood for. The KKK wore white pointed hoods and Voldemort’s Death Eaters wore black pointed hoods as seen in The Goblet of Fire. While some may be weary to believe this as evidence I think it is no coincidence. The hoods were both used to conduct their racial ideological business, keeping their personal identities hidden, to intimidate and terrorize those they saw as un-pure. \n",

Instead, it was just Hermione acting like a damsel in distress and Harry looked like he barely made any effort to save her. It all seemed like an excuse for Harry and Hermione to be bloodied up before meeting Sirius Black. Harry and Hermione don't even ask each other if they're okay as Harry is bleeding out of his stomach and Hermione has a bloody scratch on her face. They just continue on through the shrieking shack like it was whatever. And Hermione has super human strength to pick up Harry with one hand?!

Sure, that portrait can be said to be likely inert when not in 'use' so to speak but I do have a feeling that any future adaption of that scene might have to do some changes and I guess I happen to know how it should be done. From the photographs I've seen, there's a room that's likely a study that's also used to host guests. In that room is a rather ornate looking fireplace with a face carved on the mantelpiece. It's easy to imagine that this face can be animated just enough to inform the minister of the magical visitors about to arrive via Floo Powder.\n",

      "I was in York today but I didn't have a lot of time and I was lugging around some really heavy bags. Nevertheless I headed off to The World of Wizardry shop. I didn't have to queue but I felt really self-conscious with a backpack on and a bag in each hand; felt as if I was going to send customers or merchandise flying at any moment. I quickly tracked down the Slytherin scarf I was after (the lambswool one made by the Scottish place that made them for the films). Despite the sticker shock (£38!) I bought it and headed out. Later I felt foolish because with two other shops (Shop that must not be named and The Boy Wizard) I should have checked in each to see if they had it cheaper. I consoled myself with the bag/crowded shop situation but it made me think: with three shops there must be an enormous overlap of stock and maybe one shop is overall cheaper than the other two. Has anyone  been in all three and compared prices?\n",

      "I mean this is true in pretty much any fandom but it's especially true in the HP fandom. People compete over who is the most 'obsessed' with Harry Potter. For example, knowing every single detail of HP does not make you superior to other fans. It's fine if you do, but I hate people who quiz others on incredibly small and unimportant details. Also, competing over who reads HP the earliest is just silly. I read it in 2nd grade and most of the themes and stuff went way over my head.

It’s important to face your consequences even if it was out of your control.” Guarantee that in the wizarding world, she’d be the first to try to expel someone for illegal underage magic, even if they were using it to literally save their lives from dementors.

      "The Pensieve was always one of my favorite magical objects in the entire Harry Potter universe. The ability to preserve all your memories, organize them, pull them out as needed, that alone was always so fascinating and alluring to me. But the ability to take another person’s memory, and then step into it and see it first-hand, and preserve it alongside your own - I found that incredible. Dumbledore wisely understood the value of it, and I never understood why other characters did not, or if they did, never showed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once Dumbledore was gone, I found it strange that some of the characters didn’t try to access his memories in the Pensieve. I always felt it was, for Harry, an untapped resource, and for Voldemort, a potential game changer. It continues to bother me that nobody ever thought it prudent to have a look at what was in it. Many of the core characters would have found it incredibly helpful. \n",
      "\n",
      "After Dumbledore’s death, Harry, Ron and Hermione are beset with the impossible task of finding several Horcruxes, without a clue as to what they even are, nevermind where. The only person with any idea is gone, and they feel completely lost without his specific knowledge. Yet there is this object in which all of Dumbledore’s most important memories are preserved and can be viewed. Harry can barely tie his shoes sometimes, and it does not surprise me that it never crossed his mind to have a look at it. Hermione, however, should know better. Anything they know about the Horcruxes so far came from that Pensieve. It’s a pretty logical conclusion that more clues could be in there. Not to mention that they explicitly wish Dumbledore specifically were there to advise them, and this would literally give them access to his memories. Even if Hermione considered it and thought against it, the information would have been valuable enough that she would have at least brought it up to the others. Even if you assume all of this is still reasonable, you must admit that she should have at least considered the option. If breaking into Gringotts and the Ministry were feasible, this would at least be up for discussion. Even once they were inside the castle, still looking for Horcruxes they couldn’t find, why wouldn’t one of them try the Pensieve then? It just seems strange to me, still, that none of end up using it later on, but not for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really find it even more bizarre that Voldemort never used it. Whereas the 3 kids, even if they wanted to use the Pensieve, still had the obstacle of getting into Hogwarts, Voldemort did not. Once Snape became headmaster, the Pensieve was at his disposal, and by then Voldemort could easily have entered the castle at his leisure. He, too, was traveling the world seeking information, and Dumbledore’s memories would have told him everything he needed to know about the Elder Wand. Furthermore, unbeknownst to him, this quest to destroy every Horcrux would have also been made plain to him. Presumably, as a student who notably charmed the headmaster of his day, he would have known about the Hogwarts Pensieve. Dumbledore also notes how pursuant he was in discovering all the castle’s secrets. An object like this would, in theory, be really enticing to Voldemort. Whether or not he knew the information he sought happened to be there, he would know that it contains centuries of valuable secrets, and now Dumbledore’s as well. Snape, at that juncture, would not be able to refuse him, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Pottermore, the Pensieve is a complex object and most witches and wizards are wary to use one. However, Voldemort would not be intimidated by such a notion, if anything he would be emboldened. Harry is not so arrogant, but he has used it many times before, and he does use it for Snape’s memories, so it’s clearly not an issue. \n",

      "\n",
      "**TL;DR** Why didn’t Harry (or Hermione) or Voldemort even attempt to use or think of using the Pensieve after Dumbledore’s death? It should have arguably occurred to both parties, and it could have provided each with really valuable information. \n",

As a period piece of work it would not be believable for characters to act similar to what they would nowadays in 1926.
